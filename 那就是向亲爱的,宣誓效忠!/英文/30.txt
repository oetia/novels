===========================================
Chapter 1: I'm Dead, It's All Your Fault!
===========================================

It was as though he was jolted awake from a nightmare.

Rayne's eyes snapped open.

He looked around—this was his bedroom.

He came before the mirror and in it was a handsome young man from an aristocratic family.

19 years old.

Rayne had revived again.

After experiencing death once more, he was sent back to the beginning of the story.

He was Rayne Haines.

He had many titles in this country.

The Number One Successor of the Haines Empire; The Pillar of the Empire in the Future; The Exemplary Youth of Literature and Strength; Why Can't He Just Stop Hooking Up With the Wives of Others; Of Course, He Doesn’t Even Let Young Ladies Off; The Good Prince, Just That He’s a Little Rotten...

At the same time, he was also a transmigrator from a certain blue planet.

As a transmigrator, Rayne originally had a real name. However, after experiencing so many life and death reincarnations, he had already forgotten those insignificant things.

At that moment, Rayne looked at the handsome man in the mirror in a daze.

"Another failure…"

After transmigrating to this world, the mission given to him by the System was to save the world.

In order to accomplish that goal, Rayne had already died a thousand times.

However, what made Rayne furious was that half of the thousand deaths… no, at least 800…

It was all because of his inner circle's backstabbing!!

Rayne was not surrounded by deranged snitches.

That was because all the Emperor backstabbing cases were focused on seven criminals.

They were the seven Imperial Guards, the half-blooded goddesses painstakingly groomed by the Empire's orthodoxy and the ultimate experts who represented the ceiling of the human world.

On average, almost every Imperial Guard had killed this future Emperor more than a hundred times.

Rayne felt as though he had been repeating the same joke of history for the past thousand lifetimes... the Praetorian Guards1.

The process of Rayne saving the world was also the process of him exploring the bottom line of these Imperial Guard ladies.

When he first arrived in this world, Rayne was still an innocent and fat homebody.

He had a carefree life of eating, drinking, playing and hooking up with girls. His days were incomparably blissful.

The day the Emperor passed away and Rayne succeeded the throne…

He looked at the wise civil officials and heroic generals beneath the throne and he was extremely satisfied.

As for the seven beautiful Imperial Guards that knelt before him and pledged their loyalty to him, Rayne shuddered in happiness.

Rayne could not believe that this place he was in charge of saving was a Grade S world.

Just take a look at those beautiful Imperial Guards.

These artificial demigods were born after a thousand years of breeding and selection and were infinitely similar to the Goddess of Order. They possessed the strength and mental state of the Goddess.

Furthermore, their peerless beauty was enough to make even stars pale in comparison.

For a moment, Rayne could not tell if he was counting off weapons or selecting a consort.

F*ck!

Was the Imperial Army meant to be this... charming?!

He had inherited the strongest Empire in the mainland right from the get-go and had seven goddess descendants awaiting him—Rayne felt that he was the luckiest transmigrator in the world!

How laughable.

It came as suddenly as his happiness.

Rayne's funeral, that was.

The second day after he ascended the throne, His Majesty Rayne died in the palace.

Rayne's uncle, the Grand Chancellor and the richest man in the Empire, Prince Edgeworth, was crowned the next day under the protection of a few Imperial Guards.

That was Rayne's first death.

Cause of death: [A Higher Bid]

Later on, the System revived Rayne and returned him to his 19 years old self.

After being reborn, Rayne learned the lesson of his previous death and worked hard. After a series of tricks, he destroyed the prince.

However, at that moment, the naive Rayne did not understand what the System meant by A Higher Bid.

Thereafter, Rayne ascended the throne once more.

Not long after, Rayne began the first round of investigation on the officials' assets in order to clean up the corrupt culture of the officialdom.

That included the Imperial Guards.

The next day, His Majesty Rayne died on the toilet bowl.

That was Rayne's second death.

Cause of death: [A Higher Bid]

This time round, Rayne finally realized that something was amiss.

There were indeed bad guys in the crowd.

However, when those bad guys wanted to harm the Emperor, they made use of the same people!

There was a traitor in the Emperor's Imperial Army!

After his third rebirth, Rayne began to pay attention to these seemingly docile and respectful Imperial Guard ladies.

Who exactly was the traitor?

However, in reality, Rayne was still way too naive at this moment.

After dying time and again, he was tricked time and again.

Rayne discovered more and more traitors in the Imperial Army!

One traitor, two traitors, three traitors…

In the end, Rayne realized.

Apart from one person, the remaining six Imperial Guards were all traitors who only cared about profit!

It did not matter to them who the Emperor was.

No matter, this was not a big problem.

Towards this, Rayne was able to accept things rationally.

Everyone was greedy, even demigods.

In any case, there were only the seven of them in the entire country and there was no way he could replace them.

Since that was the case, he would try his best to satisfy their requests.

Therefore…

Emperor Rayne and his loyal Imperial Army could finally get along peacefully.

With the help of the seven demigods as well as experiencing many hardships and countless deaths, Emperor Rayne finally unified this continent.

Next, after gathering all the power of this continent, Rayne could finally lead the races of this continent to challenge the high and mighty Order Gods.

In the end, when the Order Gods learned that an Emperor named Rayne wanted to revolt…

They sent an edict to the Imperial Army.

The next day.

Rayne was dead again.

Cause of death: [A Higher Bid]

This time round, Rayne was stumped.

F*ck your mothers you sh*ts...

Hopeless. These Imperial Guards were utterly hopeless!

As the Emperor, Rayne could satisfy all their mortal desires.

However, Rayne was helpless against the bribes of the gods.

The tools in his hands had turned into weapons that would only retaliate against their master.

In that case, he was decided.

Bloody hell, he was going to kill all of them!

Therefore, after his umpteenth rebirth, Rayne began to use various methods to purge the Imperial Guards.

After experiencing countless deaths, he had finally grasped all the weaknesses of six Imperial Guards. Furthermore, he could skillfully kill these demigods within the first two years of his rebirth.

He only retained the single one whom he could trust.

However, reality proved that Rayne had still underestimated the potency of these Imperial Guards...

That's right.

He was backstabbed once again.

At that moment, the System spoke.

[Reminder!] [The number of deaths of the host has exceeded the maximum limit.] [The System has shut down automatically.]

After saying that, the System fell into complete silence.

Rayne went silent.

A moment later, he sighed helplessly.

"Is it finally time? I could feel that it's about time for my resurrection chances to be used up,"

There was a limit to the number of times the System could revive.

Now that the resurrection function was off, Rayne finally returned to the state where he would die if he was killed.

This life was his final chance.

Alright then.

So be it.

Rayne stretched.

What he wanted to do was the same as before.

He had to think differently and give it his all to clear this rotten world.

Prince Rayne snapped his fingers.

"Someone, send Thea Constance to see me."



===========================================
Chapter 2: Thea Constance
===========================================


Thea Constance.

She was one of the seven Imperial Guards of the Empire and was also the Imperial Guard that Rayne trusted the most in the past.

The maidservant headed towards the Church with Rayne's orders.

What Rayne had to do next was to wait patiently.

According to the rules of the Haines Empire…

The Imperial Guards would only be on call to the Emperor.

They possessed extremely high autonomy. Even if the princes wanted to meet the Imperial Guards, it would depend on their mood at that time.

Given Constance's character, she would not reject Rayne's invitation.

However, that would have to wait till she was done with her work.

While waiting for her, Rayne could think about how he should fight in this generation.

With the downfall of the System, Rayne no longer had the chance to delete the game and restart it.

His final chance dangled right before him.

After a thousand rebirths, Rayne already had a detailed countermeasure for every enemy and difficulty he would encounter in the future.

However, what Rayne could not defeat up till now were his seven Imperial Guards.

The Imperial Guards were the foundation of the Haines Empire and were the strongest individuals of this continent.

In this era, apart from the extremely special ancient mythical species, the only one who could stop a demigod on the battlefield was another demigod.

The bloodline of the gods had never stopped flowing in this continent. Apart from the Haines Empire, other countries would occasionally be lucky enough to recruit one or two demigods.

However, the quality of these wild demigods was naturally incomparable to the demigods that were officially nurtured in the Haines Empire.

Therefore, this also created an unshakable absolute military advantage for the Haines Empire.

Only, an invincible war machine had its own drawbacks.

Due to the success of the awakening ritual of the Orthodoxy Church, the purity of the bloodline of the demigods increased generation after generation. In fact, there were even super monsters with a goddess composition of more than 90%.

A high purity bloodline would bring about stronger combat strength. However, at the same time, it would cause a problem.

Identity.

The Imperial Guards no longer identified themselves as humans.

This was not a subjective thought. It was a disdain towards ants that was rooted in the bloodline of high-dimensional living beings.

They did not view themselves as humans, let alone be restrained by their morals.

According to Rayne's research, in their understanding, their relationship with humans could be compared to players and NPCs.

Although they could get along with humans happily, their natures prevented them from viewing humans as their own.

This was also the reason why the demigod Imperial Guards were only after profits and played with the mortal realm.

If he could make good use of these demigods, Rayne could easily flatten the mainland and complete the unification.

However, on the other hand, if he went overboard, this group of traitors had countless methods to backstab and kill Rayne.

It was probably… from the 200th rebirth.

Rayne no longer bore any hopes towards the Imperial Guards.

After each rebirth, Rayne would spare no effort to eliminate the group of demigod Imperial Guards until there was only one left.

All the demigod Imperial Guards underwent a series of scientifically rigorous bloodline evaluation in the Church before a most suitable candidate was chosen for fusion. These were the officially certified products that were created after undergoing various magical rituals and receiving the blessings of the gods.

However, Thea Constance was the only one who was different.

Her mother was a prostitute in a small town at the borders of the Empire while her father was an unknown demigod whose identity was still unknown to the Empire.

This caused the purity of her bloodline to be very low—it was only 50% at best.

The disadvantage of the bloodline was that without cheating, Constance's combat strength was ranked last among the Imperial Guards.

However, the benefit was that this girl was very humane and had a clear distinction between love and hate.

Rayne looked back at his first life. At that time, he did too many stupid things and wasted too much time.

19 years of precious time was wasted meaninglessly by that ignorant little fool of the past in a frivolous lifestyle.

However, in his first life, he did something right.

That winter, they passed by that small town at the borders and brought Thea Constance back from that dark basement.

As long as he had Constance, Rayne would have a shot even if he killed all the other six Imperial Guards.

In fact, by the 999th rebirth, Rayne had almost cleared the world and was only a step away from completing the final sacrificial ritual.

However, right before the final step was completed, Rayne was stabbed in the back by Constance.

Before the heart-wrenching pain in his chest dissipated, Rayne could still clearly recall the scene of the girl apologizing to him with tears in her eyes while piercing his heart firmly.

Thea Constance…

Rayne murmured the name softly.

Suddenly, an emotionless and calm voice sounded.

"Your Highness?"

Raising his head, Rayne caught sight of a beautiful white-haired demigod.

Her ravishing face lacked the necessary expression as she looked at Rayne calmly like an exquisite puppet.

As a descendant of the gods, the white-haired woman before him was no ordinary beauty. Instead, she was the exemplary answer to the abstract concept of beauty.

She wore a plain white petticoat and a coat of hollow silver armor made from elven craftsmanship. In front of her ice-blue eyes was a pair of dragon crystal glasses. As a demigod, she naturally wouldn't be short-sighted. However, those glasses were of other use.

Thea Constance.

She stood upright in front of Rayne, her voice emotionless. "Your Highness, you're looking for me?"

"You're early. Are the prayers over?"

Constance replied, "No, but Hela is back. She's on duty with me."

Rayne nodded.

He looked at Constance and said nothing more.

A moment later, he said in a deep voice, "Constance, I had a dream this morning."

"Is that so?"

Rayne continued, "Yes, that dream was very, very long, about 10,000 years long. In the dream, I was surrounded by enemies and the only person I could rely on was you. You stayed by my side, walked with me towards victory and died with me. Finally, after experiencing too much death and pain, we reached the end of the story."

He smiled and gazed at Constance affectionately. "We stood at the end of the world and all we needed was a final step to draw a perfect ending to the story. Can you guess what happened next?"

Constance's expression seemed to have changed. However, she did not say much and merely replied truthfully, "I don't know, Your Highness. Please tell me."

Rayne's expression suddenly darkened. "Then, you killed me!"

Constance: "…"

Rayne said through gritted teeth, "You said that you loved me while twisting the knife so that you could crush my heart... you crazy little sl*t!"

Constance: "…"

Although she was scolded for no reason, Constance did not seem angry.

She merely consoled him indifferently, "Your Highness, that was just a dream. You don't have to take it seriously."

"Is that so?"

"Guess I can only treat it as a dream then..."

Rayne shrugged. "The past is the past. The key is that we have to move on, right?"

Constance replied, "Yes, Your Highness."

"So…"

Rayne looked at Constance and various thoughts ran through his mind. After a few rounds of struggling to make a decision, he finally made up his mind.

He said, "Constance, I wonder if you're willing to accompany me on the streets."

"I'll be delighted. Where are you intending to go?"

Rayne smiled. "We're about to accomplish something that can change the world and bring happiness to everyone. Right now, we're about to take the first step."

"Follow me, Constance,"

Rayne's gaze was resolute as he walked towards the main entrance of the palace. "Let's go to the brothel."

Constance: "…?"

After a moment of silence, Constance followed Rayne in exasperation.



===========================================
Chapter 3: Dreamland
===========================================

Regarding Constance, if Rayne had to describe her in a single sentence, she would probably be this:

When asked to change positions during sex, she was the type of person who would just push up her glasses and answer with a straight face, "Yes, I understand."

Even among the inhumane Imperial Guards, she was also famous for her coldness and rigor.

Extremely obedient and capable of execution, she could be considered as a heroine among the tools.

However, no matter how useful Constance was, she was still just a single person.

After a thousand deaths, Rayne finally recognized the current situation. If it was just him and Constance, there should be no hope of clearing the game.

If he wanted a better outcome, he had to obtain more powerful chess pieces.

With no other choice, Rayne could only attempt to work with the Imperial Guards once more.

Yet, coercion and bribery were useless against the Imperial Guards. However, Rayne now had another idea.

Perhaps, this was the answer for the Imperial Guards to pledge their fealty to the Emperor.

Before long, Rayne and Constance arrived at the most famous gold squandering cave in the capital.

[Dreamland]

This was a majestic palace that was grand and extravagant. Just by passing by, one could smell a mesmerizing fragrance coming from within.

The wealth amassed from rich merchants all over the world over the years made this degenerate love nest even more spectacular. In fact, it could even compete with the imperial palace next door.

In the fountain at the front square of the palace stood a statue of a succubus with an enchanting figure.

Although she was made of tough rocks, she was sculpted in a life-like manner like a young girl's skin and her vertical pupils were filled with emotions, as though she could speak.

This dragon succubus that symbolized evil and depravity was looking at the imperial palace on the other end with a smile, seemingly provocative and seductive.

The name of the sculpture was Olivia and it was named after the evil god of the Nether Realm who was in charge of lust and enjoyment.

This was also the most famous attraction of the capital of Haines.

How laughable.

Rayne sneered. "The wonder of my Empire is actually a brothel."

Visiting a brothel was a cultural activity that rich people in the capital loved to experience.

However, Rayne had never been there before.

The nobles of the Haines Empire were mostly descendants of goddesses and were candidates to be nurtured as Imperial Guards. Although they loved to indulge in pleasures as well, they placed great emphasis on the backgrounds of their partners.

Therefore, they preferred incestuous relationships within their private circles.

The Rayne of the past was no exception.

However, Rayne's visit to the Dreamland today had nothing to do with seeking pleasure.

Rayne said, "You can move around freely first. I'll call you in later."

In fact, Rayne's request was extremely overboard.

An Imperial Guard's womb was a strategic resource for the Empire and the Orthodoxy Church would not allow the Imperial Guards to fool around outside.

Places like the Dreamland were even more forbidden.

Because of that, Constance reminded, "Your Highness, the Imperial Guards have to abstain from lust."

However, Rayne did not care. "This is an order."

Constance: "…"

After a moment of silence, she finally relented.

"... I understand,"

Just like that, Constance was left behind. Rayne tidied his collar and walked into Dreamland nervously.

===========================================
Chapter 4: Tragedy of the Succubi
===========================================

Dreamland.

This renowned den of vice in the Haines Empire contained a huge secret.

In reality.

This brothel was controlled by a group of fiends from the Nether Realm. They served the Dragon of Lust, Olivia and were commonly known as succubi.

According to the orders of that Monarch of the Nether Realm, they disguised themselves as humans and opened brothels in the capitals of various countries. Thereafter, they lured the local dignitaries into depravity and eventually achieved their goal of controlling the country.

Using such methods, the glory of Olivia had already taken root in many countries of this continent.

However, their operation was a failure in the Haines Empire!

They managed to transform the brothel into an iconic structure of the capital and a famous attraction of the Haines Empire.

However!

In reality, these pitiful succubi were far from as glorious as they looked.

At that moment, a group of succubi were in a meeting at the backstage of Dreamland.

As the leader, the Dragon Succubus slapped the blackboard in grief.

"You bunch of trash!"

"Look at your performance yesterday!"

The Dragon Succubus pointed to a long string of numbers on the blackboard.

"The turnover is 86,000,000 gold pieces!"

This was a huge sum of money!

Simply put, that amount of gold was enough to buy a small country or even launch a coup to topple a medium-sized country!

However, the succubi were not happy at all about the generous turnover!

All of them lowered their heads dejectedly and listened to their leader's lecture.

"There are 36 people who have converted to the Dragon of Lust!"

"What about the important dignitaries of the Empire?"

"Zero!"

"Z. E. R. O!"

The Dragon Succubus leader was about to cry as she slammed the blackboard wildly. "What sort of a lousy place is this?!"

"We've worked hard here for 30 years!"

"Yet, we didn't even manage to corrupt a single official of the Empire!"

Boohoohoo!

The succubi below the stage wiped their tears in grief.

They could empathize with the Dragon Succubus who led them.

Bloody hell!

What sort of a lousy place was this?!

After coming here for so many years, all they gained was money!

There were only gold coins!

Damn it!

What was the use of that scrap metal?!

The succubi were almost despondent and the meeting venue turned into a large-scale funeral venue.

All of them cried their hearts out.

This was not a day of sadness, but an entire 30 years of grievances!

Was the reason why the succubi opened up a den of vice among humans to earn money?

Of course not!

They wanted to spread their teachings and topple the country!

However!

Ever since the succubi arrived in the capital of Haines and spent a huge sum of money to build the initial Dreamland, in the past 30 years…

None of the dignitaries of the Empire had patronized their Dreamland!

The reason for all of this began with the twisted administrative style of the Haines Empire.

First of all, there was a reason why the dignitaries of the Empire did not patronize Dreamland.

They... had no money!

The integrity of the officials of the Haines Empire was renowned throughout the world. When the ignorant citizens of foreign countries heard it, they thought that the Empire was an ideal country established by upright and honest people.

However, that was not the case.

Although the corruption of the Empire could not be considered as serious, there were definitely many of them!

In terms of rottenness, it was similar to the other major countries.

In that case, why did the dignitaries of the Empire not have any money in their pockets?

That was because…

In the administrative structure of the Haines Empire, there was a group of behemoths that monopolized all bribery mechanisms and occupied the sidelines of the officials, enjoying the dividends of the administrative department alone!

They were none other than!

The. Imperial. Guards!

As the strongest war machines of the Empire, the group of demigod Imperial Guards had unprecedented authority.

Coupled with their greedy natures, that led to them thinking of ways to earn money for themselves.

Corruption and bribery were naturally nothing difficult. Furthermore, they had never liked to share benefits with other officials.

F*ck!

On the first day that the succubi arrived at the Haines Empire, they discovered to their shock that the Imperial Guards had already accumulated enough dirty money for the next hundred years!

The officials were all practically beggars!

There was nothing to squeeze out!

This was the extremely cruel situation of the Haines Empire!

However, due to the incomparably important military status of the Imperial Guards, no one could punish these arrogant b*stards. As such, this culture became a tradition in the politics of the Empire and was passed down from generation to generation.

As of now, those who were willing to become officials in the Haines Empire were basically idealists.

This group of hopeful officials only had the grand ambition to build a country and benefit the citizens. Every day, after work, they would either return home to accompany their wives and children or work overtime at their units.

They did not want to have fun outside nor did they have the money to do so.

In the end, the only customers in Dreamland were the wealthy merchants of the Empire.

Due to the prosperous economy of the Haines Empire, the wealthy merchants in the capital were rather rich. With their support, Dreamland grew day by day.

By now, Dreamland was even taller than the bloody imperial palace!

But, what use was that?! They did not advance the goal set by Lady Olivia in the slightest bit!

It wasn't as though the succubi could control these rich people to take over the Empire!

What kind of a joke was that?!

Although the group of wealthy merchants were indeed rich, as long as they had any thoughts of rebellion, the observant Imperial Guards would happily raid their homes and occupy their properties, devouring them until there were no bones left!

With tears of humiliation, the succubi endured the pain and operated in the capital of Haines for 30 years!

The backstage of the palace was almost filled to the brim with those useless yellow metal pieces!

Even their residential space was almost filled up!

However!

They were still a long way off their mission!

The succubi hated the Imperial Guards to the core!

However!

They even had to pay a huge protection fee to the Imperial Guards every month!

That was because their secret had long been exposed by the Imperial Guards.

However, in order to earn money, the Imperial Guards deliberately did not say anything and even covered for the succubi!

It was so that these pitiful succubi could earn money for them!

"Great Lady Olivia!"

"Those Imperial Guards are way too detestable!"

"Boohoohoo, I don't want to be bullied by them anymore…"

"If this continues, there's no way we can complete our mission!"

"I want to go home. There's no way we can produce any results here!"

"I don't want to waste my youth here!"

"Boohoohoo! I don't want to have to suck the tiny toothpicks of those big fat upstarts anymore!"

The succubi grumbled.

Even the leader, the Dragon Succubus, wanted to give up at that moment.

"One last year!"

The Dragon Succubus wiped her tears and displayed her final bit of strength. "Sisters, let's work for another year. If we can't enter the officialdom of the Empire, we'll retreat!"

Boohoohoo!

The succubi nodded with tears in their eyes and decided to persevere for another year meaninglessly.

Right then.

The door to the meeting room was suddenly pushed open.

A succubus on duty barged into the meeting room excitedly and almost shrieked.

"Sisters!"

"Good news!"

"Guess who just visited Dreamland?!"

"Who? Those rich people again...?"

The succubi were disheartened. "What good news can there be in this lousy country..."

At the very most, it was those wealthy merchant followers and how much scrap metal pieces they donated, a few worthless pieces of title deeds or merely other rubbish that sounded pricey.

The succubi were long tired of listening to such boring things.

However, the situation seemed different today.

"N-No!"

The succubus on duty said in surprise, "It's the prince of the Empire!"

"Rayne Haines!"

"He came to our place to spend money!"

The moment she said that…

The succubi widened their eyes and even their breathing stopped!

Their eyes shone brightly.

W-What was that?

The prince of the Empire?!?!


===========================================
Chapter 5: Drugged by the Succubi
===========================================

30 years.

A full 30 years!

The succubi of Dreamland had never been so enthusiastic when they received customers!

The Dreamland that was established for 30 years and earned tons of wealth and was renowned throughout the entire continent...

Finally, today!

In the true sense of the word!

Was open for business!

Their customer today was no longer a fat, politically worthless pig. Instead, it was a true core member of the Empire's power class!

The succubi were so touched that they were about to cry.

Happiness came too suddenly!

The next Emperor, Rayne Haines, had come knocking on his own!

The opportunity to topple the Haines Empire and spread the glory of the Dragon of Lust was right before them!

"Comrades!"

"Sisters!"

The Dragon Succubus was excited and worked hard to mobilize everyone before the battle.

"This is the first time we've done anything serious in 30 years!"

"There might only be a single opportunity as such in the history of Dreamland. The opportunity to change our fates is right before us. Now, it depends on whether we're determined to seize this rare opportunity!"

She declared sternly, "Swear in the name of the Dragon of Lust, Lady Olivia!"

The succubi clenched their fists with a solemn expression.

"Squeeze him dry without a single drop left!"

Dragon Succubus: "Alright, let's go!"

Thereafter, the Dragon Succubus carefully selected 10 succubi with the strongest performance and dressed them up before sending them to Prince Rayne's private room.

Even then, everyone from Dreamland felt that they were not enthusiastic enough. As the leader, the Dragon Succubus put on her own perfume and changed into a thin dress before entering the private room.

In the private room.

Rayne was surrounded by a group of succubi disguised as young girls, hugging them left and right in a carefree manner.

As a member of the royal family, Rayne had the bloodline of a goddess as well. Naturally, he was fiendishly handsome, whetting the appetites of the succubi.

Coupled with his status as the prince of the Empire, the succubi were even more motivated to attack him.

They used all sorts of tricks to pander to the prince, trying to pique his interest.

However, Prince Rayne did not seem interested in the teasing of the succubi.

He merely chatted casually with the succubi about his experiences, ranging from national affairs to how many b*tches there were in the Imperial Guards.

Prince Rayne was good at telling stories.

The succubi listened with relish.

However, they glared at his belt with resentment.

When was this prince going to get to the main point?

When they saw that Prince Rayne was not flustered, the succubi felt that their professionalism was being questioned.

At this critical juncture, it was all up to the Boss to step in personally!

The Dragon Succubus who had been observing the situation from the outer perimeter squeezed into Rayne's embrace.

After exchanging flirtatious pleasantries with the prince, the Dragon Succubus's motives were finally revealed!

"Your Highness, please try this specialty of Dreamland,"

The Dragon Succubus carried a silver wine glass for Rayne with a charming smile.

This so-called specialty wine was actually a superior-grade wine with additional ingredients.

As for the additional ingredients... fufu, what other drugs could succubi deploy?

Once the prince of the Empire took the drug, it would be much simpler for him to corrupt and induce him into degeneracy so that they could perform their duties. At that time, it would be much easier to convert him to the great Dragon of Lust!

The Dragon Succubus looked at Rayne expectantly.

Rayne did not disappoint. He raised his glass and took a sip.

Rayne savored it and praised, "Yes, good drugs!"

The Dragon Succubus was delighted and echoed, "Isn't that right? This is our... eh?"

"Y-Your Highness?"

"What did you just say?" The Dragon Succubus was dumbfounded.

Suddenly, the atmosphere went silent.

A succubus at the side wiped the cold sweat on her forehead and said with an awkward smile, "Prince Rayne should be referring to… good wine, right?"

"No,"

Rayne shook his head. "Although the wine is not bad, it's only a second-rate product. However, the Silver Blood Dew that's a specialty of the Nether Realm mixed with the wine and the scale powder of the Dragon of Lust… are all incredible stuff."

Rayne was flattered. "You guys are sure willing to go to great expenses just to drug me."

A thunderbolt exploded in the minds of the succubi.

Tsk!

They were up against an expert?!

Just as the succubi were shocked speechless, Rayne did something even more terrifying.

He raised his silver wine glass and gulped down the wine in it!

The succubi were shocked.

The prince drank it all despite knowing that it was drugged?!

As for Rayne, he looked calm after drinking the drugged wine without any abnormality.

"Although the drugs are good, I'm the Prince of Haines and the scale powder will be nullified by the bloodline of the goddess in my body. As for the Silver Blood Dew, it won't work unless it reacts with the body fluids of succubi. Sigh, what a waste of these good drugs."

Rayne wiped his mouth regrettably.

As for the succubi, they were on the brink of tears.

They were ashamed!

It was way too humiliating…

So, the Silver Blood Dew would only take effect after reacting with the body fluids of succubi?

Even they did not know about this!

Rayne, on the other hand, retracted his smile slowly. "Alright, I've drunk the wine offered by you ladies. Why don't we do something proper now?"

"Something proper?"

The succubi revealed shy expressions. "Your Highness, are you referring to how you're finally going to pamper us?"

"No,"

Rayne said sternly, "I want to crack down on prostitution."


===========================================
Chapter 6: The Loved and Distressed Imperial Guard Ladies
===========================================

Crack down... on prostitution?!

The Dragon Succubus almost cried when she heard that.

Bloody hell!

Was he f*cking with them?!

Didn't this son of a b*tch know that it was legal for them to open a brothel?

However… How could Prince Rayne not know about this?

The Dragon Succubus could not help but wonder what this prince was trying to do.

Or rather, what was he trying to investigate?

Coupled with the fact that Prince Rayne was so familiar with the local specialties of the succubi, a thought brewed in the minds of the Dragon Succubus and the other succubi instantly.

This prince came prepared.

He had already investigated Dreamland!

In that case, there was a high chance that he already knew that Dreamland was actually an outpost built by the Dragon of Lust, Olivia, in the capital of Haines...

Had this day finally arrived...?

That was the only logical answer the Dragon Succubus could come up with in her despair.

After 30 years, the reckoning for Dreamland was finally about to begin!

In reality, the succubi had long known that this day would come.

The fact that they were living beings of the Nether Realm could not be hidden from the eyes of the demigod Imperial Guards. The reason why the Imperial Guards did not expose Dreamland till this day was because they still had some benefits to reap.

However, today, that tacit understanding was about to be broken.

The Prince of Haines who represented the Haines Empire was about to settle scores with them.

But, hmm... wait a minute.

Could this be some sort of a roleplay instead?

Suddenly, the Dragon Succubus realized something and wondered if she was being overly nervous.

Perhaps the prince was just waiting for her to raise her butt and beg for mercy?

Wouldn't it be an awkward situation if she were to kill the prince and scamper back to the Nether Realm with the other succubi just because she was overly nervous?

The Dragon Succubus chuckled apologetically, wanting to test the prince.

As for Rayne, as though he had predicted the future beforehand, he said indifferently, "Don't do any vulgar performances in such a serious situation. I'm serious."

"!!!" That sentence caused the Dragon Succubus's heart to skip a beat.

T-This person... could read her mind?!

No, how was that possible?

In any case… this prince was a little difficult to deal with. If there was really no other way, she could run to the palace to seek help from those few sl*ts. Those b*tches had taken their many for so many years, it was time for them to do something proper!

Just as the Dragon Succubus was pondering…

Rayne suddenly looked at her. "Madam, what are you thinking about?"

The Dragon Succubus: "Eh? I..."

Rayne: "Don't you understand the nature of those Imperial Guards?" "They don't have integrity or morals in their minds. Isn't it a little ridiculous to ask them for help?"

W-What was up with this person?!

This time round, the Dragon Succubus truly began to suspect if Prince Rayne could read minds!

The Dragon Succubus was already stunned. She no longer knew what strange situation she was facing, but she knew that she had to escape!

Her gaze shifted continuously and she no longer dared to meet Rayne's gaze.

Rayne admired the way the Dragon Succubus's defense broke down.

He was amused.

There was naturally no way Rayne could read minds, at least not yet.

However, Rayne had already engaged these succubi in countless fights in this private room.

Rayne knew exactly what the succubi were thinking and preparing to do.

Your headquarters is right next door to my home. Do you want to guess how many times I've played with you guys in my thousand rebirths?

At that moment, the Dragon Succubus was on the verge of breaking down. However, she knew that they succubi still had a chance and could still fight!

Regarding escape methods, the succubi long had countermeasures!

Guess what was the first completed structure in the entire palace when Dreamland was built?

It was the door to the Nether Realm in the basement of Dreamland!

As long as they lied casually and thought of a way to stabilize the prince first, the succubi would be able to escape successfully through the door of the Nether Realm within a few seconds!

"Your Highness,"

With a stiff smile, the Dragon Succubus said, "Since you want to investigate, let me accompany you…"

Yes, investigate. Once I lure you to the backyard storage, I'll knock you out with a single hit

After that, I should be able to escape with my sisters!

The Dragon Succubus thought to herself.

However…

Rayne felt that it was time to end the small talk and get to the point. Therefore, he mercilessly cut off the final path of survival for the succubi.

A single sentence from the prince caused the succubi to fall into complete despair.

"Stop struggling,"

Rayne finally played his trump card. "When I came out, I brought the Imperial Guards."

At that moment.

The Dragon Succubus was finally enlightened…

Oh…

It was indeed hopeless for them.

"I-Imperial Guards?" The voices of the succubi could not help but tremble…

So, the prince was with the Imperial Guards this time round?

Weren't they doomed then?!

Rayne nodded.

"That's right, one Imperial Guard. This is someone who was forced by the Church to swear that she could not fall in love with her beloved childhood sweetheart when she was young. From then on, her heart was locked and it was as though her face was permanently paralyzed. However, she was still extremely concerned about her childhood sweetheart's private life. That's the reason why she's in a bar three blocks away right now, fully focused on his visit to the brothel."

At the same time.

In a bar three blocks away from Dreamland, a girl in a white cloak that covered her face suddenly spat out a mouthful of coffee and choked on it.

As for the despairing succubi, they were no longer in the mood to care about the gossip about the prince and the Imperial Guard.

Eventually, they asked weakly,

"So, Your Highness Rayne… what are you trying to do?"

"I don't know,"

Rayne said indifferently, "Perhaps I'll kill all of you. Or perhaps, you'll have to work for me in the future."

He was telling the truth because what he was about to do was something he had not done in his past thousand lives.

"Let's go. Bring me to the escape tunnel you guys built."

"I want to meet your god, Olivia."

===========================================
Chapter 7: Degenerate Ancient Dragon Princess
===========================================

Nether Realm.

On the other end of the world that symbolized loss of control and depravity, there were countless deformed gods that were exiled.

In the middle of the Nether Realm, there was a vast forest with beautiful scenery.

That was the home of the succubi.

In the middle of the forest, on a throne made of flowers and vines, a girl with dragon horns curled up lazily.

Her slender fingers slid gently in midair, using the petals as ink to draw the beautiful dream of the previous night on the grass—

It was a dragon f*cking a car!1

"Ah…"

The dragon girl revealed an intoxicated smile.

How perverted!

The strange dragon girl with a weird fetish on the throne was the master of the forest, the queen of the succubi. At the same time, she was a Monarch who fed on the lust of humans.

One of the strongest evil gods of the Nether Realm, the fallen Ancient Dragon Princess, the Dragon of Lust, Olivia.

At that moment, beneath the throne, a follower prostrated on the ground and trembled.

After a long time, the Ancient Dragon Princess finally noticed the visitor. She looked at the follower listlessly from her throne with bloodshot vertical eyes.

"Archduke Antoine, I don't understand. Why did your country's faith in me decrease by close to 30% this month?"

"Peerless Monarch..." The follower reported warily.

"The Haines Empire mobilized troops against our neighboring countries. Our officials are afraid we'll end up like them and are vigorously promoting the faith of the Goddess of Order."

The faith of the Goddess of Order was the state religion of the Haines Empire.

As the Haines Empire expanded, the glory of the Goddess of Order spread to other parts of the world as well.

Furthermore, it squeezed the living space of other religions continuously.

"Archduke Antoine, I don't wish for this to continue,"

Olivia pulled off a strand of hair and threw it to the follower.

"This is my dragon scale. Use it well."

The follower held her hair in reverence. "I-I understand... Peerless Monarch."

"Within a year, I want my followers to remember who their true god is. Otherwise, I'll grant you the cruelest punishment."

The follower's voice trembled. "The cruelest… punishment?"

The Dragon of Lust, Olivia, had the power to peer into human nature and see through one's weaknesses.

She saw through this mortal's greatest weakness with a single glance.

Olivia said nonchalantly, "For example... something like giving your wife a blessing so that she will only love you forever?"

"No!"

"Please don't do that!"

"Peerless Monarch!"

"Please show mercy!" The follower turned pale and whimpered in despair, begging for mercy.

As an elegant NTR enthusiast, if he had a wife who was unwilling to cheat on him, his life would be no different from falling into purgatory!2

Archduke Antoine declared, "I'll definitely not let you down!"

"I'll definitely complete your orders!"

"Great Monarch... please spare my wife!"

Olivia closed her eyes and said nothing more.

This was a signal for the visitor to leave.

Immersed in deep fear, the follower walked away with snot and tears.

Not long after, another fiend arrived beneath the seat of the Ancient Dragon Princess.

"Lady Olivia…"

The fiend said respectfully, "A ritual regarding you has been activated in the Haines Empire."

Olivia asked, "Host?"

The fiend replied, "It's the prince of the Haines Empire, Rayne Haines. He wants to communicate with you."

Upon hearing that name, Olivia's expression changed.

Slowly, she sat upright on the throne. "Who... did you say it was?"

"It's the prince of the Haines Empire, Rayne Haines."

"Rayne Haines?"

"That's right."

"Him again?!" "That's right!"

"How many Rayne Haines' have there been this year?!"

"131, Your Highness!"

"F*ck his father!"

Olivia cursed agitatedly.

Rayne Haines.

That name would be the shame of the Dragon Princess's life!

That was because last year, after Olivia was cheated of 8,000 dragon scales by a fella who referred to himself as Rayne Haines, she became the publicly acknowledged biggest fool in the Nether Realm!

In the following year, there were more than a hundred people who wanted to ask for rewards from her using the name Rayne Haines!

This was way too much!

Were they trying to rip her off completely?!

Olivia asked, "What did Rayne Haines say this time round?"

The fiend reported truthfully, "He said that he's a prince of the Haines Empire and is now abducted by a group of enemy troops. As long as you give him a thousand Reverse Scales to resolve the situation, he'll convert to you wholeheartedly and train all seven Imperial Guards of the Haines Empire into public transportation."3

Olivia was so angry that she laughed instead. "T-That excuse again?"

The fiend said, "That's right. What should we do, Your Highness?"

Olivia said coldly, "I want him to die with complete creativity!"

"Yes, sir!"

The fiend bowed respectfully to his master and left the courtyard of the Dragon Princess.

However, right after, the fiend returned in a hurry.

The fiend said, "Your Highness, another mortal has requested an audience with you through Dreamland in the capital of Haines!"

Olivia asked, "Who is it this time?"

"It's Rayne Haines."

Olivia: "…"

"Hold on, Your Highness. Don't get angry first. I think this is the real Prince of Haines!"

Olivia asked, "Why do you think so?"

"An Imperial Guard, Your Highness. It's an Imperial Guard!"

The fiend said excitedly, "He really brought a demigod Imperial Guard to meet you!"


===========================================
Chapter 8: The Strongest Imperial Guard
===========================================

The door to the Nether Realm beneath Dreamland had already opened.

The succubi stood at the side in fear and wiped their tears, mourning their tragic fate.

What the succubi did not expect was that the Imperial Guard brought by Prince Rayne was the legendary Thea Constance!

In the history of the Haines Empire, typically, the combat strength ranking of the Imperial Guards could be determined simply and crudely by the purity of their bloodlines.

The divinity of the demigod Imperial Guards produced by the Haines Empire was based on the essence of their Main God—Order.

With the same divinity and education, the lineage demigods of the Haines Empire could naturally be ranked based on the purity of their bloodlines.

However, Thea Constance was a complete exception.

Not only was she the only Imperial Guard in the history of the Haines Empire in the past thousand years who was converted from a wild demigod without any blessings, she was now also the Guard of the Capital, a historical position for the strongest Imperial Guard.

Everything made her seem extremely special.

Furthermore, unlike most demigods, Thea Constance did not seem to have any special hobbies and had almost zero interest in money and power.

Ever since she took over, she had been praying in the Church almost all day, living an ordinary life akin to the serene Buddha.

According to the insiders of the capital, Thea Constance's combat strength was clearly weaker than her six sisters due to her bloodline's purity level. However, that saying was not popular among the masses.

Could the weakest Imperial Guard be assigned to the Empress's side and serve as the Shield of the Empire to protect the lifeline of the Haines Empire?

Everyone believed that there must be a huge secret hidden in this Imperial Guard.

This Imperial Guard was probably the strongest trump card hidden in the Haines Empire.

That was also the reason why the existence of Constance was what terrified the succubi even more.

Dreamland had been operating illegally for 30 years.

As the protector of the succubi, the Imperial Guards had already treated the succubi as their own purses and could blackmail them at any moment if they were short of money.

However, Constance had no interest in such things.

All these years, the succubi had never seen this mysterious Shield of the Empire visit Dreamland even once.

But now, she was here.

Initially, the succubi merely thought that the greedy Imperial Guards wanted to join forces with the royal family to snatch away the mortal wealth they had accumulated because Dreamland was about to be liquidated.

But now, Thea Constance's appearance caused an even more terrifying guess to form in the minds of the succubi.

Did Prince Rayne bring Thea Constance with him because... he wanted to kill his way into the Nether Realm and assassinate their Ancient Dragon Princess?!

Of course, it wasn't.

Rayne glanced at the frightened succubi and naturally knew what they were thinking.

However, that was impossible.

Suppressing the gods was a script for the later stages of the battle.

Right now, Rayne merely wanted to make a deal with the Ancient Dragon Princess.

This was a brand new style of fighting chosen by Rayne.

After a thousand rebirths, Rayne had fully realized the limits of his and Constance's strength.

Even though he was familiarized with almost all the information in the world, Rayne could not avoid the outcome of being stabbed in the back.

Therefore, this time round, Rayne decided to use all the resources he had.

That included the six Imperial Guards with whom he had a love-hate relationship for a thousand rebirths.

Rayne had a way of controlling these Imperial Guards and making them loyal to him.

The scale of the planet and the depth of history gave this ancient world almost unlimited possibilities.

Even for these demigods, in their long memories, there were dozens of ways to turn them into loyal dogs under Rayne.

Unfortunately, after analyzing all the strategies, Rayne discovered helplessly that these methods could only be implemented later on or required immense resources and immense risks.

If it was Rayne in the past, he would happily gamble with his life.

But now, he only had a single life left and could no longer gamble.

Rayne could only abandon his dignity and work with his former mortal enemy.

The evil god of the Nether Realm, the Ancient Dragon Princess, the Monarch acknowledged by the two oldest creations in the world—Lady Olivia.

Working with her was Rayne's best option.

Through the passage to the Nether Realm beneath Dreamland, Rayne could easily contact Olivia and form a contract with her.

If he could obtain the support of Olivia, Rayne would not only be able to achieve his goal of conquering the Imperial Guards, he would even be able to obtain a god as his backing right away.

That was the true definition of an instant win.

At that moment, Rayne was feeling uneasy.

After all, he had never tried to work with evil gods before.

Similar to how he dealt with the Imperial Guards, Rayne had always been ruthless towards the gods.

The concept of communicating with an evil god peacefully was already extremely foreign to Rayne.

However, he was confident about this negotiation.

After all, apart from her unique status in the world, the Ancient Dragon Princess had another renowned title.

She was the most famous fool in the entire Nether Realm!

At that moment, a voice sounded from the door of the Nether Realm.

"Rayne Haines,"

That voice was from the fiend servant who sent the message on the other side of the Nether Realm's door.

"Her Highness has already agreed to your request."

"Now, you can witness the appearance of the Dragon of Lust as you wish."

The moment he said that, the door to the Nether Realm that was blocked by the pitch-black fog opened up.

Rayne took a deep breath and mentally prepared himself for the impact.

The next moment, a colorful flower garden appeared on the other end of the door.

On the throne made of thorns and flowers, the Ancient Dragon Princess sat on it elegantly and solemnly.

The Olivia before him was just a cute dragon girl with dragon horns and vertical pupils.

However, beyond that petite and beautiful body, a towering figure of a terrifying dragon that could tear the world apart was reflected.

The mountainous pressure almost crushed Rayne.

Even though he had interacted with them countless times, Rayne was still scared out of his wits each time he saw the evil gods and wished that he could gouge out his eyes.

Even Constance frowned at the side. Perhaps out of fear or hostility, the divine blood in her body was almost boiling.

This was a supreme existence that she could not challenge.

That was because this was the ultimate living being that stood at the epitome of the world—an ancient dragon in the form of an evil god.

At this moment, this Nether Realm Monarch on the other side of the door was as emotional as Rayne

After sizing up the two people outside, especially the white-haired demigod girl…

Olivia, the Ancient Dragon Princess, was so touched that she was about to cry.

It was unbelievable, the Dragon Princess could not believe her eyes.

Outside the door was an actual Imperial Guard...

The Rayne Haines this time round was real!


===========================================
Chapter 9: Attacking the Ancient Dragon Princess
===========================================


"The Prince of Haines, the future ruler of the Empire and blood kin of Order… Rayne Haines."

There was a teleportation gate beneath Dreamland.

The Ancient Dragon Princess, Olivia, narrowed her eyes and sized up Rayne.

"As you wished, I've accepted your summon. Now, state your intentions,"

The Ancient Dragon Princess's voice was cold and stern.

She had a serious look on her face.

However, in reality, Olivia was extremely excited.

How exciting…

The person who summoned her this time round was the real Prince of Haines.

The new king who was about to replace the sickly Empress and rule over the strongest country!

Although Olivia was a Monarch, her mental state had never changed much because of her status as a Monarch of the Nether Realm.

What was the saying?

Troubles never increased or decreased because of changes in class.

Monarchs had their own troubles as well.

For example, due to the massive expansion of the Haines Empire, the number of followers of the Dragon of Lust decreased. The power of lust that she could once draw from endlessly had long diminished and could no longer fill her appetite as before!

In a few years, her garden would probably start to suffer from a famine!

This psychological weakness was also the reason why Olivia was scammed of so many dragon scales back then.

But now, the real Rayne Haines had appeared before her.

Come on, come on! State your requests!

Olivia was extremely curious as to what the Prince of Haines wanted to say to her.

On the other side.

Although Rayne felt extremely uncomfortable facing this mortal enemy of the past, he forced himself to be respectful towards her.

He said, "Before explaining the purpose of my visit and conversing, Your Highness Olivia, I hope to receive a guarantee from you."

Olivia smiled gently. "Tell me."

"Your Highness, I hope that you can guarantee that you won't use any means to spy on my thoughts."

Olivia had the ability to read minds.

However, Rayne was not willing to let others spy on his brain.

Rayne's request was not for himself, but others.

As someone who had experienced a thousand rebirths, Rayne Haines was someone who understood the origin of the world and a witness of its fate.

Just like certain taboo books, if Rayne's memories were pried upon without permission, even Olivia might break down on the spot because she could not withstand the blow.

"No problem,"

Olivia was magnanimous. She knew that in the morals of mortals, privacy was an important part and must not be offended.

"Now, I'm going to explain my intentions,"

Rayne sighed internally and bowed stiffly to Olivia.

"I want to convert to your faith and become your apostle of the continent, spreading glory for you."

"Hahahahaha!" When Olivia heard that, she burst into laughter!

To think that the reason why Rayne Haines summoned her was so ordinary and unexpected at the same time!

He actually wanted to convert to her faith!

With a new follower who was the next Emperor of the Haines Empire to boot, Olivia was naturally... happy?

Happy?!

Yeah, right!

"I see. No, definitely not! I'm not agreeable to it!"

Olivia crossed both hands to gesture an 'X' and was resistant.

"Rayne Haines, take a look at yourself! Although you refuse to let me read your mind, d-don't you know something? Your expression is filled with hatred towards me!"

Olivia frowned and said in displeasure, "Right now, you look like you're pinching your nose and talking to a pile of feces!"

She questioned, "How does this look like a defection? Is this even a conversion? How am I supposed to trust you?! You merely want to use conversion as a bargaining chip to negotiate terms with me! Don't try to fool me!"

"I'm not even important in your heart. You haven't forgotten about Order at all!"

Rayne listened quietly, seemingly surprised.

Thereafter, he smiled.

It was a sincere and pleasant smile.

Olivia frowned. "Ha… what's so funny?"

Rayne said sincerely, "Your Highness Olivia, it's no wonder why you're the greatest and most respected Monarch in the entire Nether Realm."

"…?"

Olivia was stumped.

Did she say something amazing earlier on?

Why did she feel that Rayne Haines's attitude towards her had suddenly turned warm?

Rayne said in surprise, "Even I wouldn't dare to imagine that... there would be a Peerless Monarch in the Nether Realm who would be willing to let go of her arrogance and prejudice to offer to negotiate terms with a mortal."

Fufufu... that was indeed the case.

The other native evil gods in the Nether Realm were all arrogant and haughty. Every now and then, they would hold a few blood sacrifices or persecute their followers as well as a whole load of other nonsense.

No one was like her, Olivia, who was caring and amiable. Even if her followers made mistakes, she would only destroy their fetishes—there could be no other goddesses as kind as her in the Nether Realm!

Rayne Haines, I'll give it to you... you have taste.

"Fu… I'll take that as a compliment,"

Olivia harrumphed and seemed to be in a better mood. She was no longer so disgusted by Rayne's attitude.

She could understand as well. Rayne Haines was the prince of the Empire and was a blood kin of the goddess—this was someone who basked in the glory of Order as he grew up.

It would be strange if someone like this had a good impression of Olivia right from the beginning!

However, from the looks of it… after witnessing the charisma of her character, Rayne Haines had begun to acknowledge her!

Fufufufu… it's no wonder why I'm the most charming god of the Nether Realm!

Olivia was delighted as she looked at Rayne Haines in admiration.

Yes, this man was promising!

However…

What Olivia would never know was that…

All the way from Rayne's initial disgust to his passionate sincerity upon discovering Olivia's charms later on…

The entire change was faked by Rayne.

After fighting against the Dragon of Lust for hundreds of years, Rayne was definitely one of the people in the world who understood Olivia the best.

He was way too familiar with the nature of Olivia.

What a cute and gullible lass.

Rayne mocked internally.

Finally, he could get to the point of the transaction now that Olivia was coaxed into absolute bliss.





===========================================
Chapter 10: Order's Divine Punishment
===========================================

With just a few words and a comical performance, Rayne managed to gain a favorable impression from Olivia.

It was true that Rayne had figured out Olivia's temper beforehand in this game and could make use of the advantage to poison her.

However, at the end of the day, it was all thanks to Olivia's subpar intelligence.

This did not mean that the Evil God Olivia was stupid and dumb.

Although she was indeed a fool, her kind and the other gods were not much better.

Gods were not omniscient. On the contrary, they were special creations that were driven by pure emotions or bound by absolute laws.

Typically, it was difficult for something like that to make a logical, intelligent judgment.

Most of the time, they merely reacted based on their innate instincts.

At the end of the day, the gods of this world were all mentally ill to a certain degree.

After dispelling Olivia's suspicions towards him, Rayne could now negotiate terms.

He expressed his attitude respectfully. "As Your Highness Olivia said, I indeed lack reverence for you. However, that does not mean that I will revere other gods. I may not be able to contribute my faith to you yet, but we will definitely be able to negotiate a good collaboration."

Ha... collaboration.

It was true that fiends of the Nether Realm often loved to make deals with mortals.

However, evil gods had never bothered with such tricks.

Rather, it should be said that these mortals were not worthy of negotiating with the evil gods.

The mighty Peerless Monarchs could punish or bless all living beings casually based on their emotions. They did not have to follow any common sense and were unrestrained.

However, some living beings were exceptions.

Olivia was extremely willing to spend some effort to subdue a proud, wild horse like Rayne Haines.

She wanted this insignificant ant to gradually submit and degenerate, eventually becoming the bootlicker of her, the Ancient Dragon Princess, Olivia!

The process would indeed be... interesting!

Olivia smiled. "I hope that you can give me a satisfactory condition."

Rayne nodded. "I'm the prince of the Haines Empire. After I take over power, I'll do my best to manage your religion in the mortal world and offer you sufficient joy and enjoyment."

Olivia replied indifferently, "Yes, that's what everyone who expresses their loyalty to me says."

Rayne added unhurriedly, "However, apart from that, I also swear that after I ascend the throne, within ten years, your glory will spread to every corner of the continent along with the Haines Empire!"

The moment he said that, Olivia's heart skipped a beat.

Even Constance who had been silent at the side looked at Rayne in shock.

"You…"

Olivia narrowed her eyes and scrutinized Rayne carefully.

Interesting fellow…

Suddenly, Olivia realized that she could no longer see through this mortal.

With a single sentence, she completely understood why Rayne Haines wanted to cooperate with her.

Rayne wanted to do something so crazy that he had to obtain the support of a god to achieve it!

Olivia did not understand—had this hedonistic prince who pursued debauchery finally lost his mind and ejeculated all his brain juices or was he actually a promising hero...

"You want to use my power to unify the mortal world?"

Olivia smiled.

"You're definitely crazy. Order will kill you. She'll turn you into ashes and nail your soul to the crystal spear to suffer forever!"



===========================================
Chapter 11: Weakness of Order
===========================================

[Order]

She was undoubtedly the strongest among all the active gods of the Nether Realm.

At the same time, she was the Main God of the Haines Empire's faith.

It was also this goddess who contributed her bloodline thousands of years ago and imparted the method of mass producing demigods to the Haines Empire.

Furthermore, up till this day, she had been blessing the demigods of the Haines Empire continuously to ensure that the purity of their bloodlines would not be diluted with the passage of time.

She was the founder of the Haines Empire. It could be said that the reason why the Haines Empire could become the strongest country in the current era was because of the favor of the Goddess of Order.

The Haines Empire did not let down the expectations of Order. The country had an extremely firm belief in order and would execute every edict of Order without holding back.

As for the reason why Order wanted to create the strongest Empire in the mortal world, it was naturally not because the citizens of the Haines Empire were pious and firm in their faith.

It was to maintain the balance of the mortal world.

Just like her true name, Order pursued absolute stability.

Given the inferior nature of humans, they would naturally not be satisfied if the mortal world was unified.

The flames of war would only extend into the skies until they reached the palace of the gods.

That was something that the gods were unwilling to see.

The god in charge of managing the mortal world and preventing such malicious events was none other than Order.

In the simplest words, her management method of the mortal world was to cleverly support a few countries that hated one another and make them hostile to one another, maintaining a dangerous balance.

As for the Haines Empire, it was the final adjustment device for Order to maintain that dangerous balance.

The demigod Imperial Guards of the Haines Empire possessed the strongest combat strength in the mortal world. Furthermore, they could ignore physical distance and teleport to every corner of the mortal world instantly.

This allowed the Haines Empire to make swift corrections to the dangerous balance with lightning speed if there were any mistakes.

With that. the mortal world could continue operating perfectly under the ecological closure of Order.

The function of the Haines Empire was very important to Order.

However, Order did not care much about the Haines Empire itself or her followers.

Simply put, Order might not step in to protect the Haines Empire in times of danger.

However, if the Haines Empire broke free from her control, she would definitely feel a strong urge to destroy the Haines Empire with all her might.

That was also the reason why Olivia felt that Rayne was crazy.

If Rayne wanted to unify the mortal world, he would definitely attract the hostility of Order.

She was the strongest god in the current era.

Even Olivia would not cause trouble for her for no reason.

However, there was something that Olivia did not mention. Although the divine punishment of Order would definitely destroy the disobedient…

The time was not now.

Rayne was also well aware of this.

"Order is happy to see the various countries of the mortal world fight against one another. She will not tolerate the unification of the mortal world. However…"

Rayne smiled. "Your Highness Olivia, why are you testing me? You clearly know that the eyes of the Goddess of Order are not looking at the mortal world."

"Ha…"

Olivia smiled imperceptibly.

This prince even knew about that?

Olivia's gaze shifted slightly as she stared at the demigod Imperial Guard beside Rayne with a fake smile—Thea Constance.

Constance was someone who knew the rules very well. Throughout the entire conversation, she adhered to her status as a servant and added nothing towards the conversation between Rayne and the evil god.

That was despite the fact that she was already flustered at the moment and was almost suffocated by Rayne's dangerous remark.

"What a beautiful child…"

Olivia admired the body of the demigod girl, especially her blue eyes…

Thea Constance was the evidence that Order was currently offline.

That was because if the eyes of Order were still looking down at the mortal world, she would have cast a crystal spear to erase Thea Constance from the world the moment the latter was born.

But now, this girl was still alive and well.

In fact, extremely ironically, she became an Imperial Guard with the faith of Order without anyone knowing.

Chapter 12: Fall of the Demigods, Extreme Joy
That was the end of it.

Olivia's interview with Rayne had ended.

After understanding Rayne's intentions and confirming that he was not a pure fool…

Olivia decided to accept Rayne's cooperation.

"As you wish, Rayne Haines. I'll regard you as an exceptional contractor and grant you strength as well as provide you with support and suggestions… Fu, let us work together for a win-win situation."

At this point, Olivia changed the topic.

Olivia said, "However, save the effort of unifying the mortal world. I don't believe that you have the capability."

Rayne Haines: "Didn't you just say that you'll help me?"

Olivia revealed a smile that was blatantly seductive. "I need you to give me some more practical sacrifices, Rayne Haines. The mortal world is not something you can reach right now. Why don't… you start with some small matters around you?"

Rayne already knew what this b*stard wanted to do.

However, he had to pretend to be ignorant.

"You mean to say…?"

Olivia said, "I heard that the Imperial Guards of the Haines Empire have to maintain their chastity for the sake of their beliefs?"

Rayne replied, "Yes, they are the embodiment of the goddess in the human world. Loving mortals is a blasphemy against the goddess. This is something that the Church will never allow."

Of course, breeding was an exception.

Basically, every single Imperial Guard of the Haines Empire was not allowed to have any close relationship with the opposite sex in their lives. This was not only because of their beliefs, but also for practical benefits.

The demigod Imperial Guards possessed the purest bloodline of the goddess in the entire empire and they would almost certainly be the incubators of the next generation of Imperial Guards.

A demigod was not a true god after all. As long as they did not have a 100% pure bloodline, they would still have a lifespan limit. Furthermore, they would be no different from mortals and might even have a shorter lifespan.

Therefore, whether a demigod Imperial Guard could produce a qualified successor under the control of the Church was the number one topic of discussion between the Haines Empire and the Orthodoxy Church.

Under such circumstances,

There was naturally no room for the demigod Imperial Guards to engage in free love.

The demigod Imperial Guards could be domineering, overbearing and use various methods to satisfy their desires. Even if it was against the morals of the secular world, it was not a big problem.

The Haines Empire was massive enough to accommodate a few perverted jerks.

But things like love or lust…

Those were two things that the Imperial Guards must not touch.

However, exactly because those were forbidden taboos, it would feel even more enjoyable if they were broken!

Olivia smacked her lips and revealed a greedy smile.

"What I yearn for is the fall of the Imperial Guards. It's the moment when they break the taboo and give up on their faith… that moment of joy will be the sweetest sacrifice in the entire mortal world!"

Just by describing it in words, Olivia was already so excited that her heart was pounding.

"Rayne Haines, I need you to make all the Imperial Guards fall in love with you and be willing to break the iron rules of the Church to offer their bodies to you. That is my condition. For this grand occasion, I will give you the highest level of blessings for every single time you offer it to me."

Olivia smiled. "How does that sound?" "If you don't even have the guts to sleep with the few incarnates of the goddess, how can I believe that you can unify the mortal world?"

Perhaps, Olivia would think that her unreasonable request to break the thousands of years of chastity of the Haines Imperial Guards would bring pressure to Rayne Haines.

However…

Olivia's request was exactly what Rayne wanted.

What Olivia looked forward to was the moment when the Imperial Guards fell.

What Rayne looked forward to was the unconditional love and loyalty of the Imperial Guards after their fall.

Rayne: "Deal!"

Olivia smiled delightedly.

Even though she was a Peerless Monarch of the Nether Realm, at this moment, Olivia had to admit that she was tempted. Right now, she was filled with anticipation towards Rayne Haines.

"Well then, there's no time like the present…"

Olivia smiled and said, "I see that the child you brought seems to like you. She hasn't killed you despite your treacherous remarks."

She grinned at Rayne. "How about we start with her now?"

"Her?" Rayne looked at Constance.

There was fervent anticipation in Olivia's eyes. "The first Imperial Guard to fall and break the rules. Fill her with humiliation and love, sacrifice her soul to me. Rayne Haines, believe me, I will give you unimaginable blessings."

At that moment, Constance's gaze trembled.

Now…?

This evil god wants His Highness to make me...?

Constance's gaze wavered.

When Rayne heard that, he asked calmly, "Right here?"

Olivia's smile turned even brighter. "That's even better!"

Constance's gaze began to waver even more intensely.

Finally, she panicked.

Chapter 13: Blessing of the Evil God
The main entrance of Dreamland.

Rayne bid farewell to the succubi with Constance.

Rayne said, "I'll make a move first. I'll come look for you guys when I've thought about how I should use you guys."

The succubi bowed to Rayne and said respectfully in unison,

"Take care, master!"

Rayne smiled and waved to the succubi before leaving.

The transaction with Olivia was completed successfully.

Rayne became a collaborator that was personally decided by Olivia and received the first blessing from her.

However…

At the end of the transaction, Olivia mentioned that she hoped to enjoy the moment of Constance's fall into depravity.

Rayne's official reply was…

"You're dreaming."

After knowing the origin of Constance's bloodline, anyone would understand the special status this demigod girl had towards the mortal and even this world.

She was even rarer and nobler than ordinary demigod Imperial Guards.

If the fall of the Imperial Guards was comparable to a feast for Olivia…

In that case, Constance would definitely be the final main dish.

Naturally, in order to enjoy this main dish, Olivia would have to pay an equivalent price for it.

She wanted to start off with a freebie?

No way! She might as well go f*ck Order first!

Rayne knew very well that at the current stage, he only had so many cards that could interest Olivia.

The key was to see how much resources Rayne could squeeze out from Olivia with those cards.

As for Constance's first night, it was Rayne's greatest bargaining chip.

He could not use it casually.

Furthermore…

That would be very unfair to Constance. There was no way Rayne would humiliate his beloved who had accompanied him through a thousand reincarnations just to please this evil god.

The transaction with the Nether Realm had always been so ridiculous.

Fiends did not desire wealth or treasures, but emotions.

Extremely strong emotions.

For example, fiends would give the poor a pile of gold just so they could taste the ecstasy of the moment the poor obtained the wealth.

Or perhaps, they would not mind using a bunch of word games to turn a seemingly perfect deal into a nightmare of despair so that they could enjoy the sweet regrets.

The emotions that fiends yearned for varied according to the faction that created them.

As for Olivia's faction, it was naturally fervently focused on how to create lust.

To the fiends, when the noblest living beings of the mortal world, the demigods, submitted to their desires and broke the iron rules set by their mother, Order, to sink into their carnal desires...

Without a doubt, that would be the sweetest and most delicious degeneration in the world.

Therefore, even evil gods would covet it.

Although she was rejected, Olivia was not enraged.

Compared to anger, she was filled with anticipation at the moment.

She merely changed the topic immediately and bestowed Rayne the first blessing so that he could complete the deal to tempt the Imperial Guards into degeneracy.

Thereafter…

She gave the leadership of Dreamland to Rayne as well.

"The bureaucracy of your Haines Empire is way too f*cked up and these children won't be able to produce any results either. I might as well give them all to you as slaves."

Just like that…

With a single sentence from the Dragon of Lust, all the succubi in Dreamland became Rayne's tools.

This was a pleasant surprise.

As for how to make use of the succubi, Rayne had to think again.

But now, he had something else on his mind.

Rayne: "Constance."

"Your Highness,"

After leaving the door of the Nether Realm, Constance followed beside Rayne expressionlessly as usual.

Constance did not say much to Rayne.

Rayne remained silent as well.

Just like that, the two of them tacitly treated what happened beneath Dreamland as a secret that they would never mention.

However, apart from that…

Rayne leaned his face towards Constance and stared deeply into her eyes.

"By the way, do you think I've changed compared to before?"

"!"

Constance looked away hurriedly with an unprecedented blush on her cheeks. "N-No…"

"Is that so?"

Rayne was a little puzzled. He walked to the fountain in front of the square of Dreamland and looked at his reflection on the water surface.

He was still that handsome playboy prince.

However, in Rayne's eyes, a demonic purple light flashed on the traditional faint iris of Order descendants.

Rayne murmured, "The bewitching Fiend Eyes that can make divine beings sink into it... this has to be authentic, right?"


Chapter 14: Second Imperial Guard
He visited Dreamland to meet the Dragon Princess, Olivia, and successfully struck a dirty deal with her.

At this point, Rayne seemed to have achieved initial victory with his actions.

However, his troubles have only just begun.

Before long, some interested parties found out about Rayne taking an Imperial Guard with him to spend money in Dreamland.

For them, that was good news.

The Empress had been ill for a long time and her body was deteriorating. The crystal throne of the empire might welcome a new master soon.

Naturally, it was impossible for everyone in the entire Haines Palace to support that hedonistic, playboy young prince.

Rayne Haines.

To many people, he did not have the ability to rule over an empire.

Therefore, before Rayne came out of Dreamland, news had already spread to the palace through the messenger incantation.

In a garden in the palace.

Two civil officials were chatting.

"Is this information reliable?"

"Don't worry, newcomer. It's very reliable! A long time ago, His Highness the grand prince1 bribed the beggars in the capital. As long as we spend a few bags of copper coins a day, we can get these beggars to watch over the entire capital for us—even the Imperial Guards won't notice them."

"To think that… Rayne Haines would dare to head to Dreamland."

"He's a divine descendant with the bloodline of the God of Crystal, yet he went to fornicate with those filthy and lowlife fiends. He's blaspheming against the gods!"

"Finally, he has fallen to such a state as well. After this, he'll probably be even more notorious in the palace."

"Most of the people in the palace are foolish and loyal nerds. No matter how bad Rayne's reputation is, it won't stop them from being loyal to the Emperor Haines. Do you know what's the most important thing right now?"

"What?"

"We have to let the Empress know about this!"

"Indeed…"

"We should let Her Majesty recognize the truth as soon as possible. Rayne is a useless piece of trash with a vile mind and foolishness. The throne should still be inherited by the wise grand prince!"

"However, the Empress… has always doted on the prince. I'm afraid this will be difficult."

"Then we'll tell the Empress that the prince has colluded with the followers of the evil dragon in Dreamland! He has already secretly converted to the evil god!"

"Huh?! This is a complete fabrication! There's no way we can prove this!"

"But Rayne… does he have evidence to prove that he didn't do it?"

"F*ck, that makes sense…"

Dreamland was a gathering place of fiends controlled by the followers of the evil dragon—this matter was already a semi-open secret of the Empire.

However, because Dreamland had indeed contributed a large amount of revenue to the empire, coupled with the protection of many Imperial Guards, no one could touch the group of succubi.

The beggars hired by the grand prince merely saw Prince Rayne enter Dreamland.

As for Prince Rayne's relationship with the evil dragon and even his conversion to the cult, those were merely excuses made up by two civil officials to slander the prince.

However, the truth was not important.

It did not matter if it was true or not. The first thing they had to do was to complain to the Empress—that would definitely cause that prince to be drenched in blood!

It was extremely difficult to prove one's innocence when it came to impressions.

Even if Prince Rayne had a way to prove himself, it would be a stain on his reputation.

In the future, when the Empress saw her son again, he would probably not be as pleasing to the eye as before.

Of course, the two civil officials would only report the prince secretly.

As for the Imperial Guard who entered Dreamland with the prince, they would definitely not dare to mention a single word about her.

Be it nobles or the Imperial Guards, going to Dreamland to spend money was a terrible stain.

However, they did not dare to cause trouble for the Imperial Guards.

There were many people in the Haines Empire who could sit on the crystal throne. However, there were only seven Imperial Guards and they could not be replaced or defeated in politics.

Any offense towards them would attract merciless revenge.

Not to mention the unfathomable Constance.

She was the only special Imperial Guard in the past thousand years who did not have the surname Haines.

However, just as the two civil officials were discussing fervently…

In the distant Church, a gaze quietly landed on them.

Immediately after…

A dark dimensional tear opened in silence behind them.

Thereafter…

A light and charming voice sounded behind the two civil officials.

"Great officials, what are you talking about? You guys seem really happy!"

From the crack in space, an enchanting black-haired beauty put away the scythe that could tear through space and walked out slowly from the gap.

Instantly, the two civil officials tensed up and were almost suffocated from fear.

"L-Lady Hela?!"








Chapter 15: Quasigod
There was a secret in the capital.

The omnipotent Imperial Guards could use surveillance magic to its limits such that the entire capital was under the surveillance of this group of demigods 24 hours a day.

Be it the commoners or even the Empress, theoretically, everyone was always under their watch.

It was as though the Crystal Goddess was looking down at the mortal world from the heavens.

Her daughters could also see through the mortal world with ease and control the entire situation.

The officials of Haines were basically well aware of this.

However, when one was locked on by these demigods despite the vast amount of complicated information flowing through…

That fear was still enough to make one shudder.

Nothing good would come out of being visited by the Imperial Guards.

Among the current Imperial Guards, Hela's bloodline was ranked third in purity.

She fit the stereotype of the Imperial Guards in the eyes of ordinary people.

Beautiful, powerful, greedy, cold-blooded and perverted…

Against Hela, the two guilty civil officials lowered their heads hurriedly, leaving only fear in their hearts.

As for Hela, she seemed to be in a good mood with a friendly smile on her face.

"What's wrong? You're not talking?"

The two civil officials shuddered.

Due to the high purity of her bloodline of the goddess, the appearance of the black-haired beauty before them was naturally closer to that of a god and possessed a shocking charm that was almost divine.

Just by looking at her, one's heart would flutter.

If one was alone with her, he would definitely fall in love with her like a lunatic.

This was the magic of the gods and was a manifestation of their power to absorb faith.

With a joyful smile, her tone was light and her eyes were kind, as though she was easy to get along with…

However.

This sl*t merely loved to smile!

Be it on the battlefield or in the palace, she was an executioner drenched in blood.

Although she had killed many foreign enemies, she had persecuted many political enemies as well.

She was as brazen as she could be and was unwilling to be restrained.

In any case, nobody dared to blame her either.

"Lady Hela…"

The civil officials endured the pressure in their hearts and said truthfully.

"We just heard that Prince Rayne was bewitched by the evil dragon and went to Dreamland to fornicate with those fiends…"

Hela asked, "So, you guys intend to tell the Empress about this?"

Suddenly, the civil officials had an epiphany and asked in shock, "Lord Hela, are you already on the side of the prince?"

"No, I'm not on any sides!"

Hela chuckled. "However, think about it. Rayne Haines visited Dreamland and even activated the door to the Nether Realm to meet the evil dragon, Olivia… Don't you think that information is worth a lot of money?"

Those words were like thunder from a clear sky.

The two civil officials were so shocked that their hearts raced.

"Y-You mean to say that Prince Rayne has really gone to meet the evil dragon?!"

However, after saying that, their faces turned pale instantly.

This was bad!

The reconnaissance capabilities of the Imperial Guards were far superior to those few stinky beggars.

It was clear that Hela had obtained even more information in Dreamland!

Rayne Haines truly had something going on with the evil dragon!

If these were not rumors, this would be the biggest piece of news in the empire this year!

The two civil officials were dejected…

Information that was scarce was like invisible gold.

As for Hela, she was famous for her love of accumulating wealth.

Prince Rayne made a deal with the evil dragon—be it selling this information to the grand prince to deal with the prince or asking the prince himself for hush money, both were good deals.

Naturally, she would not allow anyone to share this business with her.

But now, because of their glib tongues, the two civil officials wanted to inform the Empress about this important piece of information by accident.

How could Hela sit by idly?

However, the information was already imprinted in their minds and could no longer be retrieved by Hela.

What else could be done?

Death then!

Instantly, the two civil officials understood and skillfully took out the poison they had prepared.

"We understand, Your Excellency Hela,"

The two civil officials knew their limits.

"We're all from the palace, we know the rules!" We're going to meet the God of Crystal now. See you in our next life!"

"Wait, wait!"

Hela stopped the two of them and asked in surprise.

"What are you guys doing? Do you think that I'm forcing you guys to commit suicide? Please, do I look like someone that violent?"

This time round, the two civil officials revealed puzzled expressions. "Erm… aren't you?"

Hela smiled brightly. "At least, not today. Have you heard of the Meredith Country? Last week, I went to patrol the Emerald Plain and scared those people out of their wits. Thereafter, they gave me a bunch of good stuff—here, take a look."

Hela tore open the space with ease and took out a clay jar.

She opened the clay jar.

There was a crystalline ore worm within.

Hela introduced excitedly, "This little fellow is known locally as Priestley. He's the residue of an elf quasigod and can be considered as a treasure amongst treasures!"

"Ha…"

The two civil officials were confused. They knew that Hela's greatest hobby was collecting high-end equipment from all over the mortal world.

It was clear that she had obtained another spoil of war that satisfied her during her expedition—that was also the reason why she was in a good mood today.

However, why was she taking that thing out now?

Was she intending to use this worm to deal with them?

Hela said, "Its function is to devour the souls of living beings. It can be used now."

The two civil officials were about to cry.

Tsk!

That was the bloody case indeed!

However, Hela consoled them, "Don't be afraid. This guy's lethality is very random. If you're just bitten gently by it, you'll only lose a few days of memories if you're lucky. Don't you think that this is very suitable for the current situation?"

The civil servants asked weakly, "… And if we're unlucky?"

Hela smiled and did not say anything.

The civil officials trembled.

Quasigods… those were ferocious and terrifying monsters. If they did not only target elves, they would be an ultimate nightmare that was even more terrifying than the demigods were for humans.

As for this worm…

It was a part of a quasigod's body.

Compared to being bitten by this thing, the civil officials would rather choose the poison that was effective and painless.

"How about just letting us die..."

"Hahahahaha!"

Hela burst into laughter before retracting her smile.

"No."

The ore worm's body turned scorching hot before a series of wails could be heard. Finally, with a flash of light, the conversation prior was lost eternally.

Thereafter, Hela tore open the space once more. However, she did not return to the Church to continue praying. Instead, she skipped work and went home.

"Alright, time to think about it carefully. To think that our beloved prince would make a deal with the evil dragon… How should I make use of such interesting information?"







Chapter 16: Love at First Sight
Chapter 16: Love at First Sight

The perception of a demigod was extremely strong. Even without using any spells, they could easily monitor units the size of a town with their innate blessings.

As for Dreamland…

Hela could naturally monitor every single move of this unit that was built two streets away from the imperial palace.

However, it was a pity that there was a powerful Nether Realm barrier beneath Dreamland that was enough to block Hela's detection.

Therefore, the only thing Hela could sense previously was that not long after Rayne entered Dreamland, the aura of the true form of the evil dragon suddenly burst forth beneath Dreamland.

However, apart from that, Hela did not know the details.

Of course, it was enough for her to understand things to this point.

The Haines Empire was a country with an extremely powerful religious faction.

In this country, there was only a single belief.

It belonged to the strongest human god—the Crystal Goddess, Order.

In such a country, one was practically doomed to be labeled a heretical.

It was almost certain that once the truth was exposed, Prince Rayne's inheritance rights would cease to exist and he would face a religious trial personally with a high chance of losing his life.

However…

Hela did not want to blow things up.

This had nothing to do with Rayne.

Hela was not interested in the politics of the Haines Empire nor did she have any evil intentions towards the grand prince and prince. In any case, no matter who took over, they would not mistreat the Imperial Guards.

Even if the prince died, she would not feel any heartache.

However…

Right now, she had a sister who was embroiled in this matter as well.

In the end, Hela did not visit the grand prince.

Instead, she decided to blackmail Prince Rayne.

Hela only used a split second to lock onto Rayne's location.

At that moment, Rayne had just returned from Dreamland.

After returning to the palace, he parted ways with Constance. According to the schedule given to him by the palace, he still had a sword technique class to attend.

Just as Rayne was halfway there…

Hela walked over with a smile.

Initially, Hela intended to get straight to the point and spill the truth in front of the prince. Now that the prince had just done something bad and was naturally nervous, it would be easier to negotiate with him after scaring him first.

However, something unexpected happened.

Hela smiled. "Your Highness Rayne, this afternoon…"

Halfway through her sentence, the smile on Hela's face froze.

For some reason...

Hela felt as though an electric current had surged through her heart the moment she caught sight of Rayne!

To Hela's surprise...

Prince Rayne seemed exceptionally carefree and charming today.

Faint-colored eyes, short black hair, a confident smile on his face and his decent attire—Hela liked them all.

In a daze, Hela even forgot why she called Rayne back.

When Rayne caught sight of Hela, he revealed a respectful smile. "It's Her Excellency Hela. I heard that you've returned victorious from the Emerald Plains. I was just looking for an opportunity to pay a visit to you to welcome you."

"Ah… you're too kind, Your Highness,"

Hela was a little incoherent. For some reason, her heart had been beating so fast after seeing Rayne that even her brain was not working properly.

Rayne smiled at Hela. Seeing that Hela did not seem like she had anything to say, he exchanged a few more pleasantries with her before leaving.

Hela stood on the spot, stunned for a moment.

She touched her cheek and felt a sense of surprise.

So hot...

I'm... blushing?!

For a moment, Hela could not figure out what happened. Why did Prince Rayne suddenly become so charming today?

Furthermore…

Hela went silent.

"…Why did I want to look for His Highness earlier on?"

Oh!

Right!

I came to blackmail the prince! I was here to collect hush money!

Hela turned to look at the departing prince. Although the handsome back view of the prince was gradually disappearing, there was still a lingering feeling of love at first sight in Hela's heart…

Speaking of blackmailing the prince…

For a moment, she actually felt… like she could not bear to do it.

Forget it.

Time to change a target.

Hela would naturally not let go of such a rare opportunity to earn money. Since she couldn't look for the grand prince if she had no intention of blackmailing the prince...

It was clear that Hela had no other choice.

In that case, she could only do it on her sister!


Chapter 17: Transaction Between the Imperial Guards
After bidding farewell to Rayne, Constance noticed that there were no Imperial Guards guarding the Church. Thereafter, she prepared to return to the Church and continue with her daily prayer ceremony.

However, she stopped halfway.

That was because she had noticed the meeting between Rayne and Hela.

The area of the palace was too cramped for the Imperial Guards and Constance could clearly hear the conversation between Rayne and Hela.

Hela seemed like she wanted something from Prince Rayne.

However, for some reason, Hela failed.

Hela was not someone who would give up on benefits.

Constance was sure Hela would definitely come looking for her soon.

Indeed.

A dimensional tear appeared in front of Constance and the coquettish black-haired beauty walked out with a smile.

Hela beckoned to Constance with a bright smile. "Thea, are you free this afternoon? Do you want to have tea together?"

…

In the garden of the palace, Constance and Hela sat under a pavilion, sipping afternoon tea.

Thea and Hela, the two stunning beauties, decorated the sea of flowers behind them with their bodies, forming a wonderful scenery.

However, this was a beautiful scenery that no one dared to admire.

Hela said, "Speaking of which, I actually saw you working for Prince Rayne today?"

Constance replied indifferently, "He's the future Emperor."

The future Emperor…

Yes, Rayne was indeed the successor to the throne in theory.

Unfortunately, this prince did not know that governing a country was not as simple as sleeping with someone's wife.

Hela asked curiously, "Thea, do you really believe that guy can be the Emperor?"

Constance nodded gently. "Yes, I believe so."

Constance's tone was sincere.

She was speaking from the bottom of her heart…

"Thea, it's not wise to take sides so early,"

Hela was a little helpless. "The fight for power in the royal family has nothing to do with us. Thea, the Imperial Guards never need to get involved in this mess. Although you are indebted to Prince Rayne, there's no need for you to… forget it, let's not talk about him anymore."

At the mention of Rayne, Hela could not help but recall that handsome back view. She could not help but feel her mind go into chaos once more.

Hela shook her head gently and avoided the topic of Rayne, getting straight to the point.

"Thea, you know what I'm here for."

Constance replied, "Yes, I know."

In reality, there was nothing much to talk about between the two Imperial Guards.

As an Imperial Guard, Constance's perception could also cover the entire city. Furthermore, she was very clear about her sister's capabilities and her character.

Although Hela knew about those things, Constance knew that Hela knew about them.

Similarly, Hela knew that Constance knew that she knew about them.

In any case…

With a single look, the two sisters understood each other's thoughts.

Constance said, "I understand. As long as you're willing to shut up, I'll give you a satisfactory price."

"That'll be the best!"

Hela smiled apologetically. "I'm sorry, Thea. Although we're sisters, we still have to be clear about some things."

Constance nodded. "I know."

Greed was the nature of the Imperial Guards. However, each of them had different hobbies.

Due to her unique combat style, Hela loved practical equipment and items the most.

Although she loved to accumulate wealth, in the end, the gold coins she obtained would also be used to purchase equipment.

Since that was the case, there was no need for Constance to beat around the bush.

As a fellow Imperial Guard, she had something on her right then that Hela was interested in.

After a moment of silence, she removed her necklace and handed it to Hela.

"This should be something you need."

"Mmm…"

Pondering for a moment, Hela shook her head. "Thea, you know that this is a serious matter. I'm taking a huge risk to hide it for you guys."

She was not satisfied with Constance's offer.

Constance asked calmly, "What do you want then?"

Hela said shyly, "How about your sword?"

Sword…

Constance touched the sword on her waist.

A conflicted expression appeared on her face.

"This price is way too high for me."

As a thousand-year-old Empire, the Haines Empire had a strong foundation and countless items that were compatible with the strength of demigods.

However, high-end equipment was always scarce.

For example, Constance's sword.

Ever since the Crystal Goddess Order ascended to the position of a Main God, the silver-white crystals created by the goddess had the ability to appraise the grade of magical derivatives and measure them uniformly for the mortal world.

These magical derivatives included high-level warriors who could gradually transform themselves into magical beings through training.

At the same time, magical weapons and items were included.

The division of quality was extremely simple and plain. The five colors reflected by the silver-white crystals—white, green, blue, purple and gold—were enough to encompass all non-living magical creations in the mortal world.

A golden weapon was already the highest quality weapon that could be found in the mortal world. Even as an Imperial Guard, she only had this single sword that was of golden quality.

Hela's asking price was extremely high.

However, Constance could not blame her for it either.

Constance and Rayne made a deal with the Dragon of Lust privately. It was not impossible for the Goddess of Order to kill them on the spot with her crystal spear for such a disobedience.

This was extremely troublesome for Constance.

For Rayne, it was even fatal.

Nobody in the palace was willing to cause trouble for the Imperial Guards.

However, there were many ambitious people who coveted the crystal throne and wanted to replace the prince.

Constance knew very well that Hela would have done this transaction with anyone. Given this woman's temper, it was already considered kind of her to be willing to look for Constance first.

However, to her surprise…

Hela was even kinder than she had imagined!

"Forget it, I know that you're not rich with equipment. How about this? I don't want your sword anymore."

Hela shrugged.

"Then I'll have to ask Edaline for money. She's the younger sister of Prince Rayne. She should be happy to spend money to resolve some troubles for her brother, right?"

"Forget it, that's going to cost a life." Sigh… Constance felt a little helpless.

Eventually, she gave up in exasperation.

Constance removed the mithril ceremonial sword that was refined from a dragon's soul from her waist and placed it on the table.

"Take it."



Chapter 18: The Reincarnator Who Had Reincarnated a Thousand Times
As the successor of the Haines Empire, the palace had prepared the best educational resources for Rayne.

Although Rayne was a simpleton in his first life, he still had some common sense.

As the future Emperor, there was no way he could be ignorant and incompetent.

Therefore, Rayne would study hard for most of the classes.

That was... except any classes related to combat.

Be it magic, swordsmanship or horsemanship, Rayne was not willing to put in any effort.

The reason was simple.

In the Haines Empire, even a fool knew that the Imperial Guards were the main force of this country's output. In this country where ordinary armies lacked performance, what was the use of an Emperor like Rayne practicing his sword techniques?

No matter how fierce he was, could he be fiercer than the Imperial Guards who protected him?

However, Rayne could not slack off in today's swordsmanship class.

That was because Rayne had a new teacher.

This was an important figure.

A duke of the Empire, the Marshal of the North Region Army, the initiation teacher for the swordsmanship of two generations of Imperial Guards and was lauded as the strongest mortal sword master in the Empire—Archduke Norman.

This archduke of the Empire who was in his fifties was still in his peak condition due to the tempering of his magic and martial arts. Not only did he command a large army, he was also on good terms with the Imperial Guards. The faction he led was also one of the strongest political factions in the Haines Empire.

Towards such a big shot, even the prince had to smile accordingly and try his best to please this old man.

After hitching a ride with Imperial Guard Hela, Archduke Norman retreated from the front line and returned to the capital to rest.

Upon discussion with the Empress, the archduke decided to seize this opportunity and teach the prince swordsmanship for a period of time.

The archduke had good intentions.

Archduke Norman had been a straightforward soldier since he was young. Now that the Empress was sick and Prince Rayne was the official successor of the throne, Archduke Norman was now loyal to the latter.

Since that was the case, it was only natural for Archduke Norman to interact more with the prince to establish a relationship of trust.

Also, Archduke Norman hoped that he could guide this young prince as well. After all, the current style of Prince Rayne was truly… unlike a ruler.

"In that case, before the lesson begins, Your Highness, how about you try to defeat me first,"

Archduke Norman chuckled. "Don't feel pressured, Your Highness. I'll hold back."

When the archduke and prince arrived at the usual training field and both parties wielded their swords…

The worldview of the archduke collapsed completely!

Theoretically speaking, Archduke Norman was the new teacher of the prince and did not know the level of the prince yet. Therefore, he should have a few trial rounds with the prince first to see his strength.

However, the combat strength of the prince trampled violently on the archduke's understanding of things!

Clang!

The training sword flew out of his hands and Archduke Norman's throat was blocked by the prince's sword.

Once more…

The battle ended the moment it began.

The archduke's gaze trembled and his face convulsed. He looked at the prince in horror and began to stutter.

"H-How did I lose again?! Your Highness… d-did you use magic?"

Rayne replied, "No, just plain, old, ordinary swordsmanship."

The archduke broke down. "Then why... how... are you so fast?!"

Rayne said, "I merely chose the shortest path of resistance for my sword."

The archduke asked with a quivering voice, "You mean to say… a straight line?"

Rayne, a reincarnator who had undergone a thousand rebirths and had already cultivated his swordsmanship to a godly level with 10,000 years of leisure time, shook his head calmly.

"No."





Chapter 19: Killing Into the Upper World to Pull the Plug on Order
A thousand reincarnations was way too long.

In this abnormally difficult world, Rayne experienced death and rebirth continuously. In each rebirth, apart from trying his best to find a way to break out of the situation, he spent the rest of his time nurturing some hobbies to relieve the pressure.

For example, swordsmanship, magic or combat techniques of other races.

Furthermore, most of the time, he would cultivate those techniques to their limits until there was no possibility of further improvement.

If he wanted to train his martial arts with efficiency, it was definitely not a good choice to focus on a particular technique at any cost without consideration of the time taken.

However, Rayne merely used it as a form of entertainment and did not mind how much time it would take.

Even so… he still managed to learn many skills.

Given his capabilities, if Rayne had the strength of a demigod, even ten Imperial Guards wouldn't be able to defeat him. He could barge right into the upper level of the God Realm and even pull the plug on Order.

However, letting the untalented Rayne obtain strength comparable to the demigod Imperial Guards was actually much more troublesome than crushing the Goddess of Order.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Rayne's swordsmanship could only be used to curry favor with this 50-year-old Sword Freak in the training arena and turn into some pleasant news that could increase his reputation.

Putting away his weapon, Rayne helped the shocked old marshall to the side and chatted with him for a while.

The reason why the archduke came to teach Rayne swordsmanship was because he wanted to deepen his relationship with the future Emperor. As such, Rayne would naturally fulfill his wish.

He patiently explained the principle of his earlier sword strike to the archduke.

Although the old man did not understand, he was deeply shocked.

When the archduke asked with lingering fear how Rayne became so proficient in swordsmanship...

Rayne smiled and provided an explanation.

He said that it was probably because his Crystal Goddess bloodline had awakened. Right now, his martial arts came from the inheritance of the goddess.

The moment he said that, the way the archduke looked at Rayne changed.

It was a gaze mixed with anticipation, faith and admiration.

Prince Rayne… received a blessing from the Crystal Goddess?

His Highness was indeed the Emperor chosen by the heavens!

At that moment, he saw hope in this hedonistic prince... It was hope for the Empire!

Fufufufufu...

Rayne muttered internally.

Indeed, this was the best excuse to use in the Haines Empire.

…

Night.

After a day of studies, it was time for Rayne to rest.

Usually, at this time, Rayne would send an invitation letter to a beautiful noble lady in advance or even pay a personal visit so that they could spend the night together.

However, Rayne had already lost interest in that at the moment.

He did not look for a woman but came to the Church.

According to the rules of the Church, the royal family had to come to the Church every day to pray to the Crystal Goddess.

For once, Rayne obeyed the rules today.

Upon entering the Church, Rayne caught sight of the gigantic statue of the goddess that was formed from silver-white crystals.

There was also the white-haired girl kneeling in front of the statue and praying quietly.

"Your Highness,"

Constance noticed Rayne's visit and greeted him softly.

Rayne nodded in response. Although Constance's back was facing him, he knew that she could see it.

The two of them stood in front of the statue in silence.

The two of them had not had any decent interactions since a long time ago.

Ever since Constance was taken away by the Church that day, she would no longer smile at Rayne—he could remember how chilling to the bones her cold gaze was back then.

Even so, everything that happened today made Rayne understand clearly that Constance's feelings for him had never changed.

Suddenly…

Rayne's gaze landed on Constance's waist.

He froze for a moment.

"Constance, where's your sword?"







Chapter 20: Equipment Delivery by the Evil God
"I made a deal with Hela,"

In the quiet Church, against Rayne's question, Constance's reply was extremely concise.

"Is that so?"

After obtaining the answer, Rayne did not continue asking.

After that simple exchange of pleasantries, the two of them stopped talking.

Rayne raised his head and took another look at the magnificent goddess statue.

The long-haired Goddess of Order wielded a crystal spear that was surrounded by magical power dust as she looked down at the masses with a heroic and extraordinary aura.

Even though it was just a statue, it possessed a divineness such that even heretics would want to bow down and convert with just a single glance...

Behind the Crystal Goddess was a monument.

The crystal stele caved in automatically, forming words—those were the names of the past Imperial Guards of the Haines Empire.

All the Imperial Guards were the daughters of Order and were sent into the mortal world by her to protect the Haines Empire.

"Fu…"

Rayne laughed.

This image of Order that was born naturally from silver-white crystals was a unique national treasure of the Haines Empire.

It was placed in the Church in the imperial palace and was only worshipped by the royal family and the Imperial Guards.

When the citizens and nobles of the Haines Empire looked at the statue, they saw a supreme ruler who protected them—this was a flawless goddess worthy of their lives

However, Rayne could no longer see a goddess.

He could only see an orphan of the old era turning into a tragic tumor on the bodies of all living beings of the new era, dreaming of returning to life.

Apart from hostility, Rayne only had pity for it.

After staying in the Church for a moment, he turned to leave.

…

Hela's actions did not exceed Rayne's expectations.

Imperial Guard Hela represented an extremely standard image of the Imperial Guards.

She was greedy by nature and was cruel and violent without knowing it. She only had contempt for mortals and never knew how to respect these ants—she was like the gods.

However, unlike the gods, at the very least, she was extremely warm towards her sisters.

If Rayne had met that evil dragon alone…

His odds of survival would have been 50%.

However, if Constance was implicated as well, Hela would even take the initiative to help Rayne cover things up in order to protect her.

When she met Rayne, Hela was flustered because of Olivia's blessing and even forgot about the important matter.

However, this was not a woman who would take losses.

That was the reason why she blackmailed the other party involved—her dear sister, Thea Constance.

Constance was not rich for an Imperial Guard.

She was aloof and cold, residing in seclusion without any additional sources of income. She was fully equipped with the standard equipment provided by the Haines Empire.

If she lost her only golden primary weapon, it was almost impossible for her to get another piece of equipment of the same level on her own.

However, it was not a big problem.

Rayne had long made arrangements for Constance's equipment.

Because he knew the temperament of that group of people in the palace too well, Rayne had already planned the chain reaction the moment he decided to head to Dreamland.

According to Rayne's plan, at that moment, it was time for the tool, Dragon Olivia, to send warmth.

Right then…

A dark crack appeared in Rayne's eyes.

An extremely thin door to the Nether Realm opened slowly above his eyes.

"The prince of the Empire, Rayne Haines,"

Olivia's voice sounded from the other end of the crack with a chuckle.

"Are the Dragon Eyes graced to you by your dear Lady Olivia useful?"







Chapter 21: No Male Princess!
In a physical sense, the Ancient Dragon Princess Olivia, appeared in Rayne's eyes.

Rayne's eyes received a blessing from Olivia and it was a blessing of the highest level. Because of that, his eyes became a miniature God Realm controlled by her.

Right now, the Dragon Princess could contact Rayne through his eyes at any moment and even appear in the mortal world using his body.

Through the crack in his eyes, Rayne saw the green forest that did not fit in with the chaotic and filthy Nether Realm.

Olivia was still sitting on the throne of thorns, smiling at Rayne.

She was waiting for Rayne to praise her.

"Your blessing was extremely effective, Your Highness. The moment those demigod Imperial Guards make eye contact with me, their minds will be in a mess and they will be incoherent."

"Fufufu!"

Olivia smiled happily. "Haven't I told you, Rayne Haines? Joining me is definitely the right choice. Don't worry, as long as you can please me, I'll give you even more powerful blessings that you can't imagine."

She continued asking impatiently, "So, when are you prepared to take down an Imperial Guard?"

Rayne replied, "Taming a demigod and making her lust is only the beginning. We have to take it slow."

Olivia smiled. "Indeed, it will be less enjoyable if a prey is too easily gotten. Alright, we'll follow your method and let the Imperial Guards sink into depravity."

Rayne: "However, apart from that, something else happened today."

Olivia asked, "What?"

"Hela caught hold of my weakness and blackmailed away Constance's sword."

"Sword?"

Olivia smiled nonchalantly. "So be it. Although the dragon soul and mithril are good materials, they are not suitable for her. If you want swords, I'll give you two more."

Golden weapons were rare and precious in the mortal world.

However, they were not worth much to the evil gods.

On account that Rayne was an important contractor of hers, it was nothing much to give him two golden weapons.

However, to Olivia's surprise...

Rayne rejected her flatly without thinking.

"Golden weapons are not worthy of her."

For Rayne, if it was just mere golden weapons, he would be able to pick up a few carriages full of them if he took Constance for a spin around the mortal world.

What Rayne wanted for Constance was a transcendent sacred item that was above golden weapons.

Rayne looked at Olivia through the gap in his eyes. "Honorable Dragon Princess, how about letting me do you a favor?"

"Hahaha…"

Olivia covered her mouth and chuckled. "Your words sure are interesting. Insignificant mortal, do you actually think that you can ease the worries of the gods?"

Rayne nodded with a serious and calm expression. "I can help you get rid of one of your haters."

"Man, I've got tons of haters."

Olivia shrugged nonchalantly.

Rayne said, "I'll give you a name then."

Olivia replied, "Uh-huh?"

After a moment of silence, Rayne said the sacred and ancient name, "Obadiah."

"!!!"

Upon hearing that name, Olivia's eyes lit up instantly.

Indeed, Olivia had many haters.

However, some of them were way more annoying than others...

For example, that guy.

Olivia was a little touched. Although she did not know where Prince Rayne obtained the information, to be honest, this young man was way too good at understanding dragons!

"Isn't that the son-in-law of my cousin's great-grandson's nephew? You want to mess with him? Hurry the f*ck up then!"

Obadiah was the name of an ancient dragon.

Furthermore, although they were not close, he was more or less a blood relative of the Ancient Dragon Princess.

If he was just a casual distant relative of hers, Olivia would naturally not care much about him.

However, this ancient dragon junior who was extremely young compared to the Dragon Princess had an extremely treacherous identity.

His other identity…

Was the new Ancient Dragon Princess who was about to complete the grand ritual.

That's right!

Right now, Olivia was facing the risk of being stripped of her power.

Furthermore, her opponent was going to be a male princess!





Chapter 22: Make Hela Kneel Down and Call Him Daddy


Ancient dragons.

Due to its history, the highest-level ruler of its race right now was the princess.

Olivia was publicly acknowledged as the Ancient Dragon Princess. Even though she had degenerated into an evil god, her authority as the Ruler of the Ancient Dragons was retained.

But, of course, there were definitely displeased voices.

Not all ancient dragons were willing to be ruled by an evil god.

Therefore, there were naturally many challengers who tried to steal Olivia's authority.

Obadiah was one of them.

The reason why Rayne wanted to cause trouble for Obadiah was extremely simple.

Dragons…

Well, most of them were rich.

Ordinary dragons loved to collect gold, silver and treasures. However, ancient dragons had even more elegant hobbies.

Apart from gold and treasures, they loved to collect antiques.

Naturally, antiques that could be fancied by the ancient dragons were usually extremely valuable.

A large number of rare divine treasures that were rarely seen in the outside world were piled in their lairs like trash.

If these creatures were slightly weaker, they would become targets for all intelligent beings in the mortal world to hunt wildly.

When Rayne was prepared to find a strong piece of equipment for Constance, the first thing he thought of were the treasures guarded by the ancient dragons.

This was something that Rayne did not even dare to think about in the past.

That was because not only could ancient dragons smear the ground with demigods, the most terrifying thing was that these creatures were even immortal.

If anyone dared to take their belongings, they would be hunted to death by this group of immortal mythical creatures.

But now, the situation was different!

Rayne had joined the Dragon of Lust. Right now, he had the backing of the princess of the ancient dragons!

Olivia had the authority to purge the immortality of her subjects.

As long as he could obtain the approval of Olivia, Rayne would be able to accomplish a feat that no one had accomplished since the start of the brand new era.

Killing an ancient dragon.

Olivia said, "Obadiah, I've disliked that little b*stard for a long time. However, I can't do it personally given my status."

Rayne nodded. "As long as Your Highness can eliminate its immortality, leave the rest to me."

"For real?"

Olivia chuckled and asked, "Even if it's removed from my protection, an ancient dragon isn't someone that demigods can deal with."

Rayne replied, "It's fine."

"How confident. Alright, as you wish,"

Olivia promised Rayne, "As long as you can kill Obadiah, in the name of the Ancient Dragon Princess, I'll grant you his entire collection."

That was what Rayne wanted.

Rayne: "Thank you for the gift."

"I need to kill a sl*t while you need Obadiah's treasure. We will both contribute something and get what we want in return, you don't have to thank me this time round. But speaking of which…"

Olivia was curious. "Although Obadiah is a junior, he has quite a rich collection. How much do you think his trash is worth among you humans?"

"How much is it worth?"

Rayne thought carefully before asking, "Do you know Hela Haines?"

Olivia replied, "Yes, she's an Imperial Guard from your country, right?"

"That's right. Her lifelong hobby is collecting various items and equipment."

Rayne said, "In Obadiah's collection, there's a weapon that I like. Apart from that weapon, if I give the rest of the trash to Hela…"

Olivia asked, "Give to her?"

Rayne declared with a straight face, "She will most likely end up clutching her stupefied heart in her hands and be so emotional that she will just kneel down and tug at my pants to call me daddy.

"Wow…"

Olivia's eyes lit up.

In that case…

The reason why Rayne wanted to hunt this ancient dragon this time round was not only to replenish Constance's equipment, but also to curry favor with Imperial Guard Hela?

If Rayne could gain Hela's fancy as soon as possible, naturally, Olivia would be able to appreciate that wonderful moment sooner.

Olivia licked her lips.

She was craving it again.

"Hurry the f*ck up then!"









Chapter 23: Daughters of the Imperial Guard
In a manor on the outskirts of the capital.

Imperial Guard Hela Haines was lying comfortably on the couch in front of the fireplace, enjoying the service of the servants.

Beside her, a few girls in maidservant attires and looked like gods were massaging her feet silently.

Like all the Imperial Guards, Hela's divinity was based on the essence of the Crystal Goddess Order. However, each Imperial Guard was supported by a different aspect of the essence.

Hela's pillar of support came from the former God of Elves, Life.

These girls who looked similar to Hela were all demigod puppets created by Hela using herself as the mother.

Or rather... They were her daughters.

At that moment, Hela was scrutinizing her loot—the Dragon Soul Sword that she obtained from Constance.

As a golden weapon, the quality of the sword was rather high. The Dragon Soul that was used as material had a pure bloodline and some of its components were comparable to an ancient dragon.

Hela was very satisfied.

"Yes."

She handed the Dragon Soul Sword to the puppet that was massaging her shoulders.

"You'll use this in the future,"

However, the puppet glanced at the sword and shook her head resolutely. "I don't want it."

Hela: "Huh?!"

The puppet said in a righteous and stern manner, "You extorted this from Miss Thea. She needs it more than us."

Hela was a little surprised—why was the moral standard of the puppet she created with her blood so much higher than hers?!

Hela stuffed the Dragon Soul Sword into the puppet's hands. "Thea has backup weapons. You don't have to worry about her!"

The puppet still refused to accept the Dragon Soul Sword and she smashed it onto the ground.

With a tense expression, the puppet looked down at Hela as though she was scrutinizing the latter's soul.

"However, Miss Thea only has a single golden weapon. You should know that!"

"Err…" Hela was speechless.

At that moment, she turned her head away guiltily.

Unlike the other sisters, Constance would never seek any benefits for herself and therefore did not have much money.

That golden-grade Dragon Soul Sword was her only golden equipment.

Not only was the puppet girl upright, she even educated her mother in reverse.

"Hela, if you continue to bully your sisters like this, you might end up having no friends one day."

Hela was exasperated. "... In that case, you guys return it to Constance."

"You're way too childish!"

Another puppet criticized, "Although Miss Thea is very magnanimous, how is she going to live with herself if you take away her sword but donate it back just like that?"

Hela: "Wow, nice! You guys sure are considerate!"

I really hope that all of you kind and considerate people won't hide behind me and use me as a meat shield the next time we're on the battlefield. Thank you!

Thereafter, the puppets gave their insensible mother a suitable plan.

The puppet massaging her shoulder said, "You should look for Prince Rayne and make a deal with him. Sell him the sword at a low price and allow him to return it to Miss Thea."

The puppet massaging her feet said, "That way, you won't really take a loss as well, right?"

The puppet who was pretending to massage her but was actually skiving revealed an expectant expression. "Furthermore, we can meet the prince again. Isn't that killing two birds with one stone?!"

At the mention of Prince Rayne, the other puppets revealed looks of anticipation as well.

When Hela met the prince today, she was not the only one captivated by his charm—her puppet daughters who were hiding in the rift in the void were also mesmerized.

With just that single glimpse of the successor of the Empire through that gap between time and space, the puppets found their hearts racing because of the prince's shocking charm.

It was a mysterious feeling...

Both the puppets and Hela could not help but wonder.

Could that be… the outcome of the transaction between the prince and the evil dragon?

If that was the case, that might not be such a bad transaction after all.

Hela did not mind whether Rayne used the power of the evil god to control her. After all, the so-called bewitchment was merely a blessing to increase his attractiveness.

Furthermore, notwithstanding the evil god…

The prince right now was truly a pervert!

Right then, Hela sensed something and looked out of the window.

The alarm devices around the manor were triggered.

A visitor had arrived.

Chapter 24: The Choice of Hela and Her Daughters
It was not difficult for Hela to determine the identity of the intruder.

Her perception was a blessing of the norm. Logically speaking, if anyone wanted to talk to Hela about something, they could just shout her name from their homes to attract her attention.

With that, everyone could start making deals happily.

However, according to the habits of mortals, they still liked to pay a personal visit, as though it would show more sincerity.

In reality, such sincerity was worthless to the Imperial Guards. The powerful intelligence gathering capabilities of the Imperial Guards were enough to accurately analyze a person's motives and demands through various evidence.

They could tell from a single glance whether one was sincere.

Hela looked at a puppet. "You go."

The puppet nodded.

Thereafter, the puppet girl's body melted into the dimensional rift and shuttled out of the manor.

Before long, the puppet returned.

The puppet held a receipt in her hands. "It's the envoy of the grand prince. It seems like His Highness is still brooding over you killing his men previously."

A puppet that stayed at home asked, "Is the grand prince here to cause trouble?"

Shaking her head, the puppet handed the receipt in her hands to Hela. "How is that possible? He merely wants to talk to you. This is a greeting gift."

Hela received the parchment.

This was a transfer agreement that was signed and in force.

The item that was transferred was a medium-sized gold mine located in Kent County in the south of the capital.

Yes, it was an ordinary gift.

Hela tossed the agreement to the puppet. "Keep it."

The puppet nodded. Thereafter, she arrived at the underground storage and tossed the receipt into a mountain of gold, silver and treasures.

…

The next day.

Hela visited the residence of the grand prince.

Under the lead of a servant, Hela arrived at the grand prince's study. Although she did not see the grand prince here, she saw a spell formation.

It was a voice transmission spell.

The grand prince was not in the capital.

"Miss Hela,"

A middle-aged man's voice sounded from the voice transmission formation.

In reality, as the older brother of the Empress, the grand prince was only in his forties this year. He had a noble status and was in his prime to be the ruler.

It would be strange if a noble as such did not harbor any designs on the crystal throne.

Hela was not interested in the fight for power among the mortals and had always been watching the show with an indifferent attitude towards the prince and grand prince.

Hela asked the grand prince why he invited her.

"I know that any activity within the Haines Empire can't escape the eyes of the Imperial Guards. All the demigod ladies have the ability to control the entire situation. It's just that they usually keep a low profile and are unwilling to be directly exposed."

The grand prince revealed a sincere smile. "Therefore, I'll be blunt. Your Excellency Hela, I hope that you can stand on my side in the fight for the throne in the future."

Ha!

How direct.

Without even exchanging pleasantries, Hela was asked to take sides.

However, Hela quite liked this method of communication.

It was convenient.

For mortals, fighting for the throne and taking sides was an extremely difficult and important decision.

However, for the Imperial Guards, it was merely an interesting festival at best.

Hela coughed twice and said solemnly, "The Imperial Army is the sharp sword in the hands of the Emperor. Your Highness, have you ever seen a weapon that can choose a master for itself?"

The grand prince said, "But at times, a weapon can hurt its master."

"Fufu…"

Hela narrowed her eyes.

She understood what the grand prince meant.

The grand prince wanted Hela to carry out a traditional movement of the Haines Imperial Guards.

Regicide.

To be honest, Hela was not against such work.

It did not matter who was the Emperor. In any case, everyone was part of the royal family chosen by the Crystal Goddess. It did not matter if one of them died or ascended.

The main thing was whether the money was enough.

The reason why the grand prince invited Hela to his house was most likely because he was worried that she might kill his subordinates if she was on the side of the prince.

That was the reason why he was in a hurry to rope in Hela.

The grand prince added, "I've already prepared a huge gift. I hope that you can consider it carefully."

The grand prince's intentions were clear.

If Rayne ascended the throne, Hela would think of a way to kill him.

The grand prince would then give her a satisfactory reward.

As long as there was money to be made, Hela did not mind doing such a despicable job.

After all, what was despicable was defined by mortals based on their moral standards. However, the Imperial Guards had always had a poor understanding of the morals of mortals.

However…

The current Hela had a different mental state from before.

The moment she thought of the prince's voice and smile…

For some reason, she actually hesitated.

At the same time, her daughters in the dimensional rift protested.

Compared to Hela, the puppets had an even better impression of the prince.

They were not willing to see their mother kill their favorite prince.

Finally, after pondering for a moment…

Hela shook her head.

"I'm not interested."





Chapter 25: Approach of the Prince
Hela rejected the grand prince's suggestion.

"Your Highness, you know the rules. The Imperial Guards will not interfere in the family affairs of the royal family. We are only loyal to the Emperor on the crystal throne."

"…"

The grand prince could not help but laugh when he heard that.

"Miss Hela, there's actually no need for you to come to a conclusion so early. Why don't you take a look at the gift I'm prepared to give you first?"

Wasn't it just some money?

Hela did not wish to offend the few little big shots in the dimensional rift just for the sake of earning some money.

However, the grand prince seemed to be very confident in his gift.

"Miss Hela, listen up. I'll give you an address and coordinates next. There, you'll find a gift I've prepared for you."

This time round, the grand prince did not take out any physical items. Instead, he reported a string of numbers to Hela.

Coordinates?

Before Hela said anything, a puppet in the dimensional rift moved on its own and arrived at the coordinates reported by the grand prince.

Thereafter, the puppet returned and brought about shocking news for Hela.

"Hela, there's a cave there."

"The cave is filled with gold!"

Hela was stunned for a moment. "How much?"

The puppet replied, "If it's converted into gold coins, it's around ten… billion? I-I've lost count! In short, it's just a lot, a lot, a lot! It's already piled into a mountain…"

Hela was a little surprised as well. Although the grand prince was famous for his wealth, Hela was still surprised that he could take out so much gold in one go.

She asked in surprise, "All this gold is a gift from Your Highness?"

The grand prince's voice was kind. "To express my sincerity."

Hela: "…"

Hela fell silent and wavered.

The grand prince had truly offered way too much!

"Hela. What are you hesitating for?"

However, the puppets could not take it lying down. They asked anxiously, "Are you going to agree to the grand prince?"

Hela's gaze wavered. "No… it's not about whether I'm agreeing or not. Didn't you guys see it with your own eyes? There's so much gold! That's a huge sum of money that Rayne Haines won't be able to fork out even if he sold his underwear!"

The puppets persuaded, "Hela, we already have a lot of money!"

Hela frowned—she had finally run out of patience towards her nagging daughters.

"Haven't you guys had enough? I naturally have to stand on the side with the most money. Why are you guys so protective of Rayne Haines? Even if Rayne Haines made a deal with the evil dragon, the person he wanted to bewitch was Thea, alright? What has it got to do with us?!"

The puppets were speechless. "B-But…"

Just as Hela and the puppets were arguing…

Suddenly, the panicked voice of a servant sounded outside the study.

"Your Highness Rayne... y-you can't come to this place!"

"Ha, interesting. The entire Haines Empire belongs to my family and you're telling me that there's a place I can't enter?!"

The study door was pushed open violently.

The intruder was none other than the prince of the Haines Empire, Rayne Haines.

Amidst a plot against Prince Rayne in the residence of the grand prince, the target himself had unexpectedly barged into the scene.

The moment he pushed the door open and entered, the prince's demonic eyes snatched away the gazes of Hela and the puppets.

Hela and her daughters were dazed once more as their hearts raced…

With a relaxed expression, Rayne walked into the study openly like a close relative. He looked at the spell formation on the ground with a smile and took out the wine that he had painstakingly prepared.

"My dear uncle, your filial nephew is here to visit you!"





Chapter 26: Shy Puppet
Prince Edgeworth was Rayne's uncle. At the same time, he was the first enemy Rayne encountered.

For Rayne who had been reborn endlessly through reincarnation, every time he restarted, he had to deal with the grand prince first. Over time, destroying the grand prince was as easy as eating and drinking for Rayne.

Regarding this Beginner Boss whom he had fought a thousand times, Rayne knew when the grand prince would play punk and how he should counter every action—he had memorized everything and it was almost like instinct.

The grand prince's voice was dark. "Rayne…"

The moment Rayne Haines appeared, the grand prince's calm and amiable demeanor vanished.

Rayne greeted respectfully, "Uncle."

"Rayne Haines, this is my residence. I didn't invite you today."

Rayne smiled. "That's right, you didn't invite me. You invited Her Excellency Hela. Speaking of which… What were the two of you talking about?"

The grand prince grit his teeth. "It has nothing to do with you."

Rayne walked into the grand prince's study with ease, arriving before the bookshelves as though he was in his own home.

Instantly, the grand prince turned nervous. "What are you doing?!"

Rayne skillfully found an ordinary-looking dictionary on the bookshelf.

Thereafter, he withdrew an IOU from the dictionary.

"Let me see what this is… Prince Edgeworth of the Haines Empire borrowed a billion golden swords from Gold Village. They were forged into gold bars and transported to the Caines Islands in the North for storage."

Rayne read the contents of the IOU and revealed an incredulous expression. "Uncle, were you intending to bribe Her Excellency Hela with dirty money borrowed from the enemy?"

The grand prince was extremely agitated. "Bullsh*t!"

At the side, Hela was enlightened.

So… the gold was borrowed from the dwarves of Gold Village by the grand prince?

It was no wonder why the grand prince could fork out so much money in one go.

However, Gold Village was named as a calamity in the edict of the goddess. As the grand prince of the Haines Empire, what conditions did Edgeworth use to borrow so much money from the dwarves?

Hela's gaze gradually changed.

The grand prince was even more exasperated. "Rayne, how dare you slander me! That IOU was clearly prepared by you to frame me, right?!"

Rayne laughed. He ignored the grand prince and continued smiling to himself.

"Seems like you need more evidence, uncle. Since Her Excellency Hela is here as well, why don't I state a few coordinates for her to take a look at?"

The grand prince said angrily, "That's complete slander! Miss Hela, don't listen to that lad's nonsense!"

When Hela heard that, she opened her mouth, wanting to say something…

However, at that moment, the dimensional rift opened up on its own and a puppet popped her head out. "Your Highness Rayne, if Hela is unwilling to help, we can run the errands for you."

The puppet daughters knew the big picture. If the grand prince was truly in cahoots with external enemies, things would not be as simple as an internal strife within the royal family.

In order to prevent her avaricious mother from doing any more lousy work, the puppet girl appeared from the dimensional rift happily and remarked to Rayne.

Rayne smiled. "Thank you, Histia Hela."

The puppet was shocked and stammered shyly, "A-Ah… Your Highness, you actually know my n-name…!"

Chapter 27: Father of the Puppets
Theoretically speaking, Hela's puppet daughters were descendants created by Hela using the power of the Goddess of Life.

However, Hela was still a mammalian after all.

It was still a little difficult for her to reproduce alone.

Therefore, apart from the genes of a mother, her daughters required a separate entity to be matched as a father.

In order to ensure the purity of the demigod puppets' bloodlines, Hela naturally had to choose the best father bodies she could find to create the puppets.

In that case, within Hela's reach, who else apart from herself would make the best father bodies?

Naturally, it would have to be her Imperial Guard sisters.

The three daughters that Hela had created right now used the blood of her dear sisters as their father bodies.

In order to save trouble, Hela decided to use her sisters and her name to name her puppet daughters.

For example, Histia Hela was a puppet created by Hela after she extracted the blood of the eldest sister of the current generation's demigod Imperial Guards, Histia Haines.

Of course, apart from a few Imperial Guards, not many people knew about this.

Those who were slightly more knowledgeable merely knew that Hela possessed a group of puppets that looked similar to her. Even those who knew would not be able to match the names of the three girls who looked similar to her.

Therefore, the puppet girl was moved when Rayne managed to say her name correctly.

Initially, she thought that Prince Rayne had merely become more handsome. To think that… he was so considerate.

"Your Highness Rayne…"

The puppet girl blushed and murmured Rayne's name.

In the dimensional rift, the other two puppet girls could not help but feel a little more expectant towards Prince Rayne outside. Since he could identify Histia so accurately... did it mean that perhaps... he knew their names too?

On the other side.

It was different from the ambiguously sweet atmosphere between Rayne and the puppet.

At that moment, the grand prince was so nervous that he broke out in cold sweat.

In a county to the north of the Haines Empire, Prince Edgeworth had just completed another transaction with the dwarves of Gold Village.

Rayne was not wrong at all.

Indeed, the grand prince was making a deal with enemies of the Haines Empire.

As the second successor of the Haines Empire, the grand prince could not resist the temptation of the crystal throne. In order to become the king of the strongest Empire that ruled over the mortal world, the grand prince had staked almost everything.

Everything he had, even his dignity, was used as a bargaining chip.

What he did not have yet was used as collateral and converted into the resources before him.

The thing that did not belong to him for the time being was naturally the Haines Empire.

The billion golden swords was one of the investments that Gold Village made for the grand prince. The dwarves would assist the grand prince to ascend the throne with all their might. By the time the grand prince ascended the throne, the dwarves would make a killing.

Although he did not think that his plan was flawless, he had not expected… Rayne to expose his plan so easily and hit the nail on the head!

At that moment, on the other end of the voice transmission formation, the grand prince wiped away the sweat on his forehead with a trembling hand.

The scene transmitted through the formation.

He looked at Rayne.

Rayne was also looking at him.

The grand prince could read disdain and mockery in his nephew's eyes.

Traitor.

It was as though he could hear his nephew scolding him that.

Chapter 28: Bad Prince
Rayne found evidence of the grand prince colluding with external enemies and even invited Imperial Guard Hela to use teleportation to retrieve more evidence of the grand prince's crimes.

The grand prince was stunned.

Due to his fear and nervousness, his mind went blank in the face of this extremely dangerous situation and he could not think of any countermeasures.

The atmosphere in the study became extremely tense.

The grand prince could not believe that his ending would come so suddenly. In the blink of an eye, he went from being a schemer behind the scenes to being dragged into the open by Rayne and beaten up viciously!

If Rayne were to produce more evidence, the grand prince would be finished.

Colluding with external enemies was not a small matter.

Depending on the evidence found by Rayne, the most tragic outcome might be for the Church to step in with the crime of blasphemy. They would nail the grand prince to a crystal pillar and drain his divine blood before burning him to death!

At this moment, Hela's puppet daughters readily agreed to the prince's request and waited for him to report the coordinates.

It was as though tragedy was predestined.

The journey of the grand prince would come to an end today.

However…

Right then, the strangest turn of events happened.

Rayne was about to speak when he suddenly recalled something.

He looked at the IOU in his hands and sized it up, frowning sternly.

Thereafter, he crumpled the IOU into a ball and tossed it casually.

"I was wrong. This IOU is fake. Sorry for disturbing you, uncle,"

With that said, Rayne left the grand prince's residence right away.

There was no hesitation at all.

Fake…?

The grand prince was dumbfounded and his heart skipped a beat.

That IOU was clearly authentic!

The crisis that had appeared suddenly was resolved instantly as well.

Now that Rayne was gone, no one would expose him anymore. This made the grand prince heave a deep sigh of relief.

However, after a moment of relaxation, a chill enveloped the grand prince.

Fear struck him continuously and even seeped into his bones…

The grand prince clenched his fists and grit his teeth. "Rayne… what are you trying to do?!"

…

After leaving the grand prince's residence, Rayne walked to a quiet place.

Rayne asked, "Your Excellency Hela?"

The moment he said that, a dimensional rift opened up and Hela came to Rayne's side with a smile.

Hela asked, "Is there anything, Your Highness?"

Rayne smiled. "Sort of."

After Rayne left, Hela did not linger at the grand prince's place and bid farewell as well.

Regarding the outcome of Rayne's stand-off with the grand prince, be it Hela or the puppets, neither was surprised.

Prince Rayne merely did something that was even more common than eating and drinking for their mother.

Catching hold of someone's weakness and blackmailing them thereafter.

It was clear that Prince Rayne had long known about the grand prince colluding with Gold Village.

Collecting information was an ability.

However, how to make good use of information was an art.

Rayne's choice of timing was extremely ingenious.

It was the same as when he visited Dreamland previously.

This time round, the prince even used an Imperial Guard as his shield.

Right now, apart from the grand prince and prince, Imperial Guard Hela was included as well.

With that, the situation changed drastically.

If the prince was the only one who knew about it, the flustered grand prince might try his best to silence the prince the moment he lost his cool.

Although it was a dirty move, it was an option nevertheless.

But now, the situation had changed.

Under the watch of Hela, it was no longer realistic for the grand prince to want to silence the prince.









Chapter 29: Initially, I Wanted to Refuse, but His Highness Gave Too Much
If the prince were to suddenly die one day, regardless of the cause, Hela would know that it was the grand prince's doing.

Furthermore, she could conclude that everything Rayne said was true.

At that time, the grand prince would be in an extremely dangerous situation.

Although the Imperial Guards were not interested in the morals of the mortal world, they still had to abide by the ironclad rules written in the edict.

The Imperial Guards were happy to watch the internal strife within the royal family.

However, once the royal family committed treason, the Imperial Guards would no longer be standing by the sidelines.

The grand prince was spared by the prince.

However, he was now in a desperate situation.

The prince had a hold on him but there was nothing he could do about it.

Before the fight for the throne even began, the grand prince had already lost half of it.

Of course.

Right now, there was also someone who could reverse this adversity.

It was still Hela.

That was because Hela also knew a secret that belonged to the prince.

Similar to the grand prince, the prince had also committed a crime that violated the ironclad laws of Order.

The prince colluded with the evil dragon and even received her blessing openly.

If Hela was willing to tell the grand prince about this, he would be able to turn the tides and return to the same starting line as the prince.

If they both had a hold on one another, it would be equivalent to nothing.

Hela thought to herself…

The actions of the prince and grand prince had seemingly allowed her to be the greatest victor to reap the rewards.

In that case, what should she do?

Right now, in the dimensional rift, the three little big shots were bewitched by Rayne's sugar-coated shells.

As demigod puppets, the few of them had less tolerance towards the corrosion of the Nether Realm than the actual Imperial Guards to begin with. As such, they were even more affected by the prince's bewitchment.

The three puppet girls were delighted just by the prince mentioning their names accurately.

If Hela chose to work with the grand prince to deal with Rayne, the three little big shots might just bring down the entire house.

However, the problem was…

If Hela wanted to side with the prince, was he able to offer a deal that could meet her demands?

"Your Excellency Hela,"

At this moment, Rayne's voice woke up Hela who was deep in thought.

He smiled at Hela. "Just like my uncle, I actually have a gift for you as well."

"Oh?"

Hela raised her brow. "Your Highness, you're going to be generous for once as well?"

Rayne nodded. "We'll talk as we walk."

He led Hela towards the palace.

"Lady Hela, you know that compared to my uncle, I'm not considered rich. I'm afraid I won't be able to produce any treasures that satisfy you either."

Rayne said, "Therefore, I intend to do the same as my uncle and offer you something I obtained from others."

"You're too kind, Your Highness. So, what are you intending to give me?"

At this moment, Hela did not take Rayne's gift too seriously.

She did not think that Rayne could offer anything more tempting than a cave of gold.

However, it did not matter. As long as the prince could ensure that she did not suffer losses, she did not mind being more biased towards the prince in the political fights in the palace in the future.

She couldn't help it—her children preferred this man.

However…

What the prince said next nearly caused Hela to explode on the spot.

"Let's talk about this in private. Well, you know that I made a deal with the evil dragon, Olivia. After that, I convinced her yesterday to help me remove the immortality of an ancient dragon."

Rayne chuckled and asked, "Lady Hela, are you interested in hunting an ancient dragon with me? I only want two of the treasures obtained after the deed is done. The rest are all yours."

"Pfft!"

Suddenly, Hela stood stiffly on the spot and spat out a mouthful of blood.

By now, she had gone completely numb.

Chapter 30: Professional Order
Rayne's suggestion shocked Hela completely.

Hela was dumbfounded as she looked at Rayne without saying anything.

The elimination of the immortality of an ancient dragon made hunting an ancient dragon possible.

This was something unimaginable in the mortal world.

As an ancient and rare race, due to their long lifespans, every single ancient dragon occupied an extremely important position in their society.

The loss of every single ancient dragon would shock the entire race.

Coupled with the fact that they were protected by an incomparably powerful god…

The eventual outcome was that after Olivia advanced to become an evil god, she gave everyone in her race an immortal body with a wave of her hand.

As long as Olivia was not injured, the entire ancient dragon race would be able to share her eternal glory.

Of course, unruly idiots were the exception.

At that moment, Hela was shocked at the generosity of the evil dragon, Olivia, to be willing to sacrifice a comrade to strike a deal with Rayne.

She did not dare to imagine how big of a deal this lad had committed to the evil dragon...

However, as a beneficiary, Hela decided to ignore that.

Of course, what Hela did not know was that Rayne had practically taken advantage of the Ancient Dragon Princess for free.

When Rayne signed the contract with Olivia, one of the hidden benefits that he had expected was the chance to loot a few lairs of the ancient dragons.

And now, Rayne decided to use an ancient dragon's lair to upgrade Constance's equipment. At the same time, he would give the remaining trash to Hela to curry favor with her.

Rayne was not willing to let Constance complete the mission to suppress the ancient dragon.

Right now, the quality of Constance's equipment was poor. Furthermore, it was not yet time to unlock many of her cheats. As such, it would be difficult for her to deal with the ancient dragon.

However, Hela, this orthodox Imperial Guard, had been extorting and looting everywhere like a diligent bee ever since she took over the position. Eventually, everything was exchanged for high-quality equipment that suited her style.

Her equipment set had long been formed and she was a perfect human tool.

However, even for Hela who was fully equipped, she could only force a smile in the face of a mission to suppress an ancient dragon.

Hela was in disbelief—did His Highness Rayne think that… she alone could take down an ancient dragon?

Wasn't he thinking too highly of her?

In theory, the Imperial Guards were the ceiling of any conflicts in the mortal world.

However, there were still countless apocalyptic existences in the mortal world.

The elf quasigods and ancient dragons were part of them.

However, the problem was that although they were strong, they would not pose any threat to humans for some reason.

If one were to take a look at how badly the elves were scammed by their own gods, the danger of attracting other hostile mythical creatures would be obvious.

As for the other mythical creatures that filled the secluded corners of the mortal world, they coincidentally ignored the existence of most civilizations and would not clash with them.

Although they existed there, for various reasons, they unanimously avoided civilized countries and lived their lives isolated from the world.

It was as though all the coincidences were deliberately arranged by someone.

In reality, it was true.

The balance of the mortal world had been adjusted by Order singlehandedly.

In fact, the quasigods were personally created by Order.

In order to suppress the elves, she allowed this noble race with the highest chance of unifying the mortal world to fall into a desperate situation where they were hunted by their own gods.

That was also the reason why humans had the opportunity to rise.

Support, suppression, restraint and destruction. Under the will of the Crystal Goddess, the mortal world became chaotic but orderly. The flames of war raged but it was filled with vitality.

All life and death eventually formed this endless mortal world.

As a goddess, Order was not only dedicated, she was extremely professional as well.

Because of that, as the daughters of the Goddess of Order, theoretically speaking, the Imperial Guards should not break the ecological balance meticulously set up by Order and attack those harmless mythical creatures rashly.

However…

With money on the line, who the hell would care about that?!

After a moment of mental struggle, Hela quickly thought things through.

She asked, "So, Your Highness, you hope that I'll be the one to destroy the ancient dragon before we split its belongings?"

Rayne answered, "What do you think about it?"

"This can't be called a gift, Your Highness,"

Hela chuckled. "This is your reward for me."

She approached Rayne with a smile and held his hand intimately, saying solemnly, "As your loyal Imperial Guard, it's my greatest honor to serve the future Emperor!"
